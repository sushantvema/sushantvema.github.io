# Website Project Research and Discovery

I want to create a website that is fully powered by markdown data. The website need not be reactive. Each page on the website should represent Markdown data. The website should be easy to version control. The UI/UX should be appealing and customizable. It would be nice if I could configure OAuth or manage accesses to certain pages or subfolders. 

What type of data do I want in a Markdown file? Plaintext, headings, metadata, simple diagrams, media (photos and videos). 

If I want reactive elements like a forum, I need to put in the work.
