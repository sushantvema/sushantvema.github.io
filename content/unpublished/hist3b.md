# Hist 3b: World History from 1500 Onwards

Chatbots can be helpful in terms of adaptive learning and asking questions. Use them in participation boards. Rephrase and rewrite in own terms. 

Can definitely not use them for essay questions. 

For the textbook, you should cite it as a source. 

## Unit 2: New Encounters - The Creation of a World Market

The rise of the Atlantic world. 16th century globalization. 1789 is the french revolution. Early modern vs late modern. 
1517, wrote up 95 theses against what he perceived about the corruptness of the Roman Catholic Church against the selling of indulgences. Something that, for a fee, would keep a sinner out of Purgatory. 

The nailing of the 95 theses in Vittenburg triggered a revolution. Gave birth to many different species of Christianity which immediately went to war with each other. 

Course notes and chatbots are called secondary sources. All primary and secondary sources must be cited.

### The Europeans Emerge from the Darkness

Euope is coming out of the "dark ages" (medieval history) which was presided by the Roman Catholic Church and allied artistocrats. Europe was surrounded by the "opulence of the Islamic world". 

Portula, on Western Iberian peninsula comprised of kingdomes of Castile and Aragon. The "Reconquista" or unification of the two kingdoms and crusades against the Moors allowed the Europeans to push southward to the Mediterrancean and key straits. 

Completed in 1492 with the fall of Granada. 

Some communities like the Sephardic Jews managed to survive bloodshed and violence of the fall of Granada. 

Allowed access to straits of Gibraltar and toward Islamic Africa, home of Berbers and wealthy societies of West Africa for gold trade.

Portuguese kingdom preserved independence from Spanish kingdoms through conflicts wihch culminated in late fourteenth century under King John. Made him the first "Lord of Ceuta" or controller of small but strategic area opposite Straits of Gib in North Africa. 

Prince Henry (The Navigator) is famous because under his tenure, there was a massive shipbuilding effort. Project of exploration, trade, and colonization. Portuguese effort was lead by Prince Henry who founded and placed his name to the School of Navigation which helped to pioneer efforts at exploring coast of Africa. 

Two main efforts. Trade with West Africans to gain part of gold dustr trade monopolized by Berbers. Medieval goal was to reach Christians lost in distance African lands. Myth of Christian king in Africa called Prester John. Africa has Christians but they weren't European. Christian churches in Egypt and Ethiopia still exist to this day. 

Wanted to discover southern-most point of Africa. Port's wanted to circumnavigate ancient Eurasian trade networks like Sild Road. That was made famous during Middle Ages by Marco Polo's bestseller, Il Millione. Being able to establish such trade could make impoverishsed medieval king wealthy beyond dreams of avarice. These dreams eventually achieved by Port's, Spaniards, Dutch, and British. 

Bartholomeu Dias achieved goal in 1488. Named cape of Africa "Cape of Storms". Sounded off-putting to the adventurous, so geographical discovery was re-named for Europeans as "Cape of Good Hope".

VDG arrives on Malabar coast of India at Calicut in 1498. Greeted by Muslim trader to asked why he has come. Responded: "Gold and souls."

For Spans, rather than going east, an Italian Adventurer by name of Christoffa Corombo pushed idea of his brother (would-be map maker) by advocating a western route, taking the trade winds to India. Corombo thought this was reasonable because he thought the world was a lot smaller than the Hellenistic calculations. Convinced Queen Isabella of Spain and was on his way.

Maps were garbage, but was lucky because he ran into the Caribbean islands. He called this the West Indies. Proclaimed the Arawak people he encountered on the island "Indians". 

Columbus also noticed goals in the nose of one of the aboriginal people. He forced the people to dig up all the gold there was to be found. Columbus lay ground work for plantation system principally to raise sugar. Sugar was highly labor intensive. Europeans spearheaded creation of a market in forced labor from coast of Africa. Increasingly profitable system of early modern capitalism also called the triangular trade.

Ferdinand Magellan's ill-fated voyage began in 1519 and was completed in 1522. First successful circumnavigation of the globe in the age of globalization. Magellan, a Port sailor, sailed for Spain. Sailed around South America where he met the vast Pacific. Food stores failed and starvation and survy ravaged fleet. Died after reaching Asia on an island that he named after his sponsor, Spain's King Phil II (Philippines). Surviving crew mates with remaining ships filled with pepper became rich. First era of capitalist globalization, lead by Iberian Empired, fortified by chattel slaver had begun.

#### Ted Ed: The Atlantic Slave Trade

Brought more than 10 million Africans to America. Not enough labor in new plantations. African slavery had existed as indentured servitude and serfom historically. 

African kings and merchants viewed the people they sold as criminals, debtors, and POWs from rival tribes. Kingdoms prospered from the slave trade. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences. Became motivation for war. Needed European fire arms. Slave trade became arms race. 

Captains cut off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Africans thought whites were cannibals. Africa lost much of able-bodied population. Most of people taken were men.

African economies collapsed, open to conquest and colonization. Development of racist ideology. 

Europeans who preached Christianity needed justification for practice so at odds with their ideal of equality. Acquired racial basis. 

#### Video: Ferdinand Magellan Part I

18 emaciated and starving men in an unrecognizable ship arrives at Seville 500 years ago. "Victoria" first ship to circumnavigate the globe. 

Opened last great ocean, created new trade routes, and showed the true vastness of our planet. 

Modern replica of Magellan's ship is circumnavigating the globe. 

1519 voyage starts. Spices were worth more than gold. Whipstaff arrangement. Feedback between the rudder and the till. Brute strength to be on course. Magellan never revealed the source of his belief of the existence of the route. It probably existed in secret circles of 16th century navigators. 

Keeping the crew in the dark would be extremely dangerous. Almost led to his destruction. 

Magellan was a man of contrast. Very physically short, very self-confident. Man of few words. Paid attention and cared about his family. The man disappears behind the project. Spent 8 years as a soldier with the Port fleet in Indian Ocean. 

Slighted by the court after arrival back in Port. Now he wanted to prove everyone wrong. Wanted to finish un-finished exploration of Columbus. Last great untried sea voyage around South America. 

Leaders of such nature are lonely by definition. Never let anyone else understand the complexity of the passage.
