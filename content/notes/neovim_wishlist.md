# Todo
- Treat wrapped paragraphs as individual lines when scrolling: [Discussion on visual line scrolling on r/neovim](https://old.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1dybryf/my_complete_neovim_markdown_setup_and_workflow_in/lc8a0d5/)
- Discovery on possibilities for better code blocks in Markdown files. Change the indentation size based on language
- Autocommand hooks mentioned in [[knowledge_scripting|Knowledge Scripting]]
- Autocommand hook to automatically add a YAML frontmatter whenever I create a markdown document in my knowledge ocean.
- Unicode integration to write in Indian languages

# Done
