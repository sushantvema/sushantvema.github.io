# Top of Mind

# Timetracking

# Meetings
## Data Standup
- Some contract project managers will be hired. Not sure if they'll be converted to full time. 
- Alex: Ingestion testing. Continue doing incremental ETL. 
- Ryan: Priority is Sephora. Told them that we can get the results by mid-day today. 
- Sushant: Spreadsheet automation
- Cyrus: Already voiced concerns about AWS. Setting it up ran into permission issues. Alex needs to help on that. The price of the platforms we're in is not good. AWS is truly the most difficult solution. Sagar thinks it's the easiest. Taylor can't do it, Alex is busy. Neither of them is a Devops engineer. Sagar is preoccupied with the vector store. Every day it's becoming more and more clear that qdrant is what we're going to go with. 
## Sephora
- Need to do a post-mortem on this project
- Taking them too seriously. They don't know what they want

## Meeting with Ankit
- Testing takes some time. Endpoint was scaled to zero. Tested internally using locust. Very similar to spark setup. 
- Number of concurrent users and hits the endpoint. 
- RPS spikes imply server failures
- Try 180 as the number in the notebook. 
- Min and max as 6k 6k. 
- Throughput is actually quite high relative to what we see in general for 3.1 70b. 
- 9-10:30 AM PST tomorrow is the window of opportunity for scheduling a call.
