Lately I've been feeling bad. I've not been sleeping well. I've been eating too much. My personal hygiene is not consistent. I've been shirking responsibilities. I'm not exercising. 

I feel like all of my friends are so happy, but I'm just somewhere else completely. I don't feel like I have ownership of my life. I've been making impulsive actions. 

In spring 2024 semester, I signed up for a life coaching class, but, like other things, I dropped it. It just wasn't a priority for me, or I felt like it wouldn't help me to improve my life. 

Whenever I am ignored, I stop putting in effort and feel like I am being taken for granted. I'm an overconfident decision maker. Sometimes I am too careless in my speech or actions. 

The solution is probably to spend more time on less amount of things. Minimalism. And to train my concentration. And to make sure I am making progress, since evaluation is one of the most important things in an engineer's toolkit.
