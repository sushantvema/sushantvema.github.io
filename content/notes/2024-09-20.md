# Meetings

## Brickflow Introduction Meeting
DSL - Domain Specific Language
Lots of examples of Domain Specific Languages. 
Day in day out, we are writing a lot of notebooks, python components, etc. We want these components to orchestrate. Should be able to be deployed in a repeatable fashion. Teams use DSLs to simplify. Sagar helped build this workflow
By default, Databricks came with their own orchestrator. First people to commit to Airflow. The entire world uses airflow today for running and orchestrating data pipelines. 
Workflows and airflow orchestration was not that seamless. So relevant today that many folks use it. Nike runs everything in Brickflow. 

Whatever ETLs we create in the team, all the ETLs should follow one standard structure. Today, we all write them very differently. We need to remove the guessing game from the structure, deployment, management. Opinionated framework. 

1. Go to Concepts and read that instead of the quickstart. 
2. Write a small demo ETL. Put it in Github. Kick off a CI/CD pipeline. 

Become a master in the concepts and the whole setup. 
How we can start templatize ETLs. 

Monorepo style. Make a confluence document with learnings from this.
