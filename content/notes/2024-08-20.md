## Deedi/RPM Platform Work Catchup
- Ongoing effort led by Emile and team. Ingestion piece. Savings calculation model. Visualization component on powerpoint. Radial. 
- "RPM Approach Methodology". Helping the consultant to add commentary before they get to the numbers. 
- Carlo is mostly interested in the status of the roster mapping project. Populating the RPM database. Gazillion different pieces as well as a manual path. Opportunity calculation. Very high potential overlap.
