# Week 4 - Era of Reform, War, and Transition

## Guidelines

### Learning Objectives and Knowledge Outcomes: 
When exploring the material this week, use the following thought prompts to focus your approach to the subject matter at hand; upon completing the assignments for this section you will be able to outline learned information, demonstrate an understanding of historical facts, apply your knowledge to historical discussion, breakdown ideas and employ evidence to support particular claims, compile component ideas into a whole historical argument, and make and defend judgements based on evidence and reason.  These thought prompts are not part of your writing assignments for the week, but rather serve as points of inquiry to help you focus on particularly important areas of information as you dig into the readings, film, and discussions.

### Unit Themes
#### Unit theme: America's great age of reform: achievements and failures on the path of progress. 

Offer an appropriate definition of early twentieth century Progressivism.  Explain why this massive array of reformist impulses coalesced in the first decades of the twentieth century.  
Explain the basic elements of Progressive ideology.  Identify and critique the goals and outcomes of Progressive reform.
Assess how the Progressives sought to accomplish their goals and what political, social, and economic changes resulted from Progressive challenges to established systems.
Describe why Progressivism ultimately came undone in the late 1910s-early 1920s.  Identify the extraordinary successes of Progressivism's challenge to the status quo; also mark where Progressivism utterly failed to truly reform American society.
Explain how and why women's rights were reshaped during the Progressive era.  Examine too where women found a space to organize and agitate for change within the various movements that fell under the greater umbrella of Progressivism.  

#### Unit theme: Influence of the First World War on the United States and the birth of modern America. 

Describe and analyze how balance of power politics, national rivalries, nationalist aspirations, colonial territorial disputes, militarism, and military treaties contribute to the coming of the First World War.  Assess why was the fighting so destructive.
Explain the various reasons why the United States enter the war in 1917.  Assess the role of American economic interests in the nation’s entering the fray.
Appraise Woodrow Wilson’s ultimate geopolitical goals during the war period and in its immediate aftermath.
Historian Eric Foner claims: “For all the Wilson administration’s exalted rhetoric of the war being about freedom, the war inaugurated the most intense repression of civil liberties the nation has ever known.” Explain what Foner is referring to and detail why this widespread repression of civil liberties was enacted with such ferocity.  
Identify who in America benefited from the nation's involvement in the war.   Also identify who experienced the most hardship or resistance as a result of the war.  Analyze how these beneficial and negative outcomes took shape.    
Distinguish how the war rearranged geopolitical power.  In particular, assess how the United States's involvement in the war changed the nation's place in the global order.  
Explain the many ways that World War I affected American society. 

#### Unit theme: The 1920s: America's "anything goes" decade.

Describe and analyze the general emotional state of America after World War I. 
The 1920s were a period of contradictions: an era of boisterous excess commingled with almost Puritanical conservatism.  Explain why American society experienced such polar tugs during these years. 
Assess how the presidencies of Harding and Coolidge embodied the social, political, and economic mood of the times.
The post-World War I decades were a period of heightened nationalism, anti-immigrant sentiment, anti-Semitism, and permeating racism.  Identify the factors that contributed to the intense racism and xenophobia defined the 1920s.  Analyze why this period witnessed such a toxic strain of bigotries, prejudices, and intolerance.   
Assess how racial, religious, and ethnic minorities respond to the negative pressures oppressive policies and social practices.   
Explain the rise of "new woman" of the 1920s and how did she influence American society.  
Describe how Harlem became a center of American cultural achievement during the 1920s.  Explain why such robust artistic and social movement took place there and then.     
The 1920s produced a number of America's most historically prominent writers (e.e. cummings, Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Jeanne Toomer, Zora Neal Hurston, John Dos Pasos, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Gertrude Stein, Robert Frost, Ezra Pound, H.L. Menkin).  Assess what made the 1910s-1920s such fertile ground for literary brilliance.       
The United States witnessed dramatic changes to the national economy in the 1920s.  Breakdown the basic shifts in production, investment, debt, consumerism, and consumption that defined this transitional era.  Assess too the role played by advertising in the encouraging greater consumer acquisition.  
Identify and analyze the fatal flaws or unsustainable economic principles that undermined the basic health of the national economy in the 1920s.
