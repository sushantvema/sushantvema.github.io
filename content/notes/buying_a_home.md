# 4 Questions to Ask Before Buying a Home
1. Are you debt-free?
2. Do you have a 20% down payment? Avoid PMI
3. Do you plan on living in that area for at least 10 years?
4. Are you ready to be a homeowner? The last place you want most of your wealth is in a personal residence.

# Total Cost of Ownership
There are many more costs above mortgage.

Maintenance costs. Repairs. Paint house every 7 or so years. A/C, roof, heater. 

Home is a liabilities because you always need to pay out of pocket for things. 

Over the course of the last 30 years, it's been 2-3% average appreciation. 

# 20-30-3 Rule
- 20% down payment -> no PMI, if second house, roll equity from first home into second home
- 30% or less of your income needs to be spent on housing. For financial independence, 20% is better. 
- 3x household income. Comes from Millionaire Next Door. Majority of millionaries had purchase prices of homes 3x or less of total household income. 

# Dial in the budget. 

# Get preapproved for a mortgage
- They will base it off of 36-40% of your income. In 2007 they based on 50%+ of your income.
- High interest rates. Shop around for lenders. At least 3-5. Know all of the fees closing a home. 
- You'll get approved for way more than you think. Pre-approval letter. 

# Define housing needs and wants on paper
- Home buying is very emotional. This gives you a checklist ahead of time. Do not waver from this list. 
## Needs
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage of the home
- Home office
- Size of yard
- Neighborhood
- School District
- Public transport

## Wants
- Pool
- 3 car vs 2 car garage
- fully renovated kitchen/bathroom

# Agents
- Getting a rental license can be helpful. If you ever get into investing in rental properties, with a license you can just walk in without having to meet someone. 
- Big settlement happened with National Association of Realtors did away with the 6% commission. 

## Hiring an Agent
- First time homebuyers, maybe helpful to have a buyer's agent. 
- When there's a multi-offer scenario, having a buyer's agent may put you at a disadvantaged. 
- Sweeten the deal with seller's agent. Make the offer with 1-2-3 seller's credit and 1% commission. 
- Interview a few agents to find one that's right for you. 
- Make sure to fire subpar agents quickly, to not waste both of your time. 

# Househunting
- Agent will send you MLS listings. Set up alerts for daily or hourly basis. 
- People will come in with cash offers. 
- Look at houses on the market for the long time. As they get closer to expiry, sellers will be motivated

1) Location
2) Size of the home
3) Future resale value

This guy looks for houses needing massive cosmetic upgrades. It's not a big deal as long as you factor in contracting costs. 

No big capital expenditure requirements. Like roof repair, brand new A/C, leak in the pool, etc. 

Find the fixer upper in the best neighborhood in the area. Guaranteed appreciation. 

# Make the offer
Be very stoic. 

Now you generally have to come in at or over asking. 

Agent will submit a formal contract. Standard real estate contract per state requirement. 

Submit the pre-approval letter. 

Submit contingencies. 

1) Have an inspection period. Have a home inspector come in and inspect the property. NEVER forgo a home inspection. 
2) Look at electrical, heating cooling, plumbing, caulking, lighting, attic, mold, wind mitigation, four point inspections, etc. Only costs a couple hundred dollars to maybe 1.5k. 

## Negotiation
Keep a final number in your head. 

# Offer is Accepted
Now generally at least 7 days for home inspection. They'll give a report. 

Figure out what are all of the things needed to be repaired in the house. 

Can go back to seller and renegotiate.
