Evaluating model drift in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications in production is an important task to ensure the ongoing **quality**, **relevance**, and **safety** of the system. Here are some key approaches:

1. Regular performance monitoring:
- Track key metrics like [[deepeval#Evaluating Retrieval|relevance scores, retrieval accuracy]], and [[deepeval#Evaluating Generation|generation quality]] over time.
- Use automated testing frameworks with a curated set of queries to detect changes in output quality.

2. Data distribution analysis:
- Monitor the distribution of input queries and retrieved passages.
- Look for shifts that could indicate changing user needs or data staleness.

3. Relevance feedback:
- Collect and analyze user feedback on the relevance of retrieved information.
- Track changes in user satisfaction or task completion rates.

4. Retriever-specific evaluations:
- Measure retrieval precision and recall on a test set periodically.
- Analyze changes in embedding space or clustering of retrieved documents.

5. Generator-specific evaluations:
- Use [perplexity score](https://blog.uptrain.ai/decoding-perplexity-and-its-significance-in-llms/) or other language model metrics to detect shifts in generation quality.
- Compare generated outputs to reference answers or human evaluations.

6. End-to-end testing:
- Regularly run a diverse set of queries through the full RAG pipeline. Can be augmented with synthetic data generation.
- Compare outputs to expected results or have human raters evaluate quality.

7. Data freshness checks:
- Monitor the age of retrieved documents and their last update times.
- Implement alerts for when critical information sources become outdated.

8. Concept drift detection:
- Use statistical divergence tests to detect shifts in the underlying data distribution.
- Monitor for the emergence of new topics or terminology not well-represented in the training data.

9. A/B testing:
- Periodically compare the current production model to a baseline or newly trained version.
- Evaluate performance differences to decide if retraining or updates are needed.

10. External knowledge integration:
- Cross-reference outputs with authoritative external sources if possible.
- Flag discrepancies that could indicate outdated or drifting knowledge.
