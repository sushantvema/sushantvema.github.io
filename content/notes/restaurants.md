A list of restaurants I like. I don't eat out often, but when I do, I love to try new foods. There are plenty of ways to organize this information but, I'll do it by locale for now.

# California
## Bay Area
### Pleasanton
- **Brava Garden Eatery.** Downtown Pleasanton, Argentinian Fusion Food. $$$. Went on 2024-07-27 with a party of 3.
