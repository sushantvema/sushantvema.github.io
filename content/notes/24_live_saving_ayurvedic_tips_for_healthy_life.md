These tips will directly come from my mind and experience. I'm 20M from India and have been sick most my life and on medications until I decided to change me lifestyle. Not on a single med for past 2 years and not planning to in future.

1. Avoid excess sugar, salt & caffeine. See for alternatives like jaggery/honey as sweetner ( stevia not healthy ) / Non iodised salt like rock salt / black salt. Arjun Tea instead of Caffeine or Tanin tea. Alternative method to have Caffeine mentioned in point 8.
2. Avoid chemically processed seed oils - I think this is most important in life. Use cold pressed oils like - mustard oil, sesame oil, groundnut oils and even better if you can afford ghee or butter.
3. Avoid non stick utensils. Use stainless steel, iron, ceramic or mud utensils.
4. Have a good sleeping schedule.
5. Avoid eating after 7pm or 8pm at max or your body will have to work harder to digest the food while you're sleeping.
6. Have milk 30 mins before sleep with pinch of turmeric, black pepper, honey & saffron (3-4 thread only) this is good only if you ate your dinner around 7 pm and assuming you're gonna sleep between 10-11pm. Do this daily and see improvements in your sleep.
7. Have warm water in the morning and sip it slowly while sitting in a Squats position. If you wanna add lemon and honey then you can I prefer mine just water.
8. For breakfast have fruits and dry fruits/seeds (always eat dryfruits after soaking it overnight as they are very hard for stomach to digest if consumed raw and less is better )

After you have your breakfast wait for atleast an hour or 2 to have your coffee or tea. But better if you find an alternative like cocoa milk, arjun tea or just ginger/cardamom milk.

9. In lunch have high protein, fibre & carbs with some probiotic to digest it better.

10. Have a light dinner. And better to have a snack meal 1-2 hour before lunch to keep yourself almost full at dinner time.

11. Walk more and avoid lifts & escalators. This is life changing it'll only a take a minute more to walk the stairs instead of going in a lift plus it'll be healthy for your knees, fatloss & cardiovascular health. Only if it's 1 or 2 floors lol.

12. Consume fibre with non veg as it'll help to digest them properly.

13. Eat more fruits literally the best thing you can do for youe body is eat more fruits. They hydrate your body more than water.

14. Drink water but not in excess as you should be having your hydration from fruits & coconut water type things.

15. Have a carbon water filter at your home and avoid tap water.

16. Always drink everything while sitting.

17. 10-20 mins walk after each meal. Helps in better absorption and digestion.

18. Massage your body with any cold pressed oil 1-2x a week.

19. Have organic soaps.

20. Read ingredients of everything you consume as you should know which thing you're consuming. HAHA literally your life depends on it. Avoid white flour it's very unhealthy.

21. When outside ask if they can cook your food in olive, coconut oil or butter.

22. Avoid electronics 15min before sleep.

23. Get more sunlight in early morning and in evening without sunscreen.

And if you get more tan or burns or scared of skin cancer from sun google the side effect of vegetable and soyabean oil. When you'll start avoiding these oils in your diet you'll not need any sunscreen eventually. Wear them if it's extreme hot around 12pm - 4pm after and before that it's the healthy sunlight which your body needs.

24. These tips are not in correct order as to start your day but compare them with your lifestyle and maybe even Google about them and how they are beneficial for you. Read them again and again and ask me any question I'll be happy to answer them.

Tip for ladies only - You should avoid Birth Control pills. They are dangerous. Not gonna say much about them tho. You should Google about them.

My grandfather was a yoga guru who's famous in my city and Haridwar where the largest Ayurveda facilities are available. My life changed when I started listening to him & yog guru Swami Ramdev.

Also avoid food with artificial colors, fragrances, & preservatives. Try eating things fresh. Sorry for the long post and not so good English haha.

> Very good tips and almost all match advice from my Ayurvedic teacher and doctor from India. The only one that seems to differ is the recommendation of only fruit for breakfast; my teacher recommended the have instead a strong and nourishing breakfast as the body has the longest time to digest it.Thank you 🙏

> There is probably something scientific to it that op could answer better than me but sitting gives your body a better chance to digest. Leaning to the left while sitting let’s the pyloric muscle open for better digestion.

Also digestion starts in your mouth. Also heard that if you have any issues with digestion you can boil the water prior to drinking it will be lighter ( before it’s called raw - learned that recently ), but hey it make sense in away. Same with food ( easier to digest when it’s cooked )
