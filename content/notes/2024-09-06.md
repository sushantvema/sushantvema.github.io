### Daily Stand Up

### Demo

### Sushant Cyrus Sync
- Anj is getting more lucrative contract. Really difficult process. 
- Can take the rest of the day off. 
- Anj is more worried about the ETL finishing on the time. Alex could use some help. Put a pause on ML stuff for a day or two and help Alex get him through the finish line. 
- Will get that rolled up for Monday morning. Monday meeting for all three of us. Only other person apart from Alex who will have an expertise on this. In a few weeks, we'll be doing Instagram, Snapchat, etc.
