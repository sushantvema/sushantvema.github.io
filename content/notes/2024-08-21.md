## Databricks Benchmarking Meeting with Ankit et all

## 9:45 - Data Team Standup
- Ryan: Modifications to the dashboard that come up. Reporting notebook on and off. Schedule time with Alex next week to go through that. Consistent airflow errors. 
- Alex: Demographic Pro stuff. Starting pipelines for them. Handoff to Ryan. Getting put into the final catalog. Also working on qdrant Kubernetes cluster. Doing it manually didn't work out, but using Sagar's Terraform script. Close to completed. Probably don't need Taylor's help to deploy this. Incremental ETL ingestion progress: 
- Cyrus: Meeting after to discuss the high level priorities and progress of Search. Sephora data dump was dropped today. Current dashboard is only the first 1000. 
- Sagar: Tuning and batch transform jobs running. Tested out a couple of things. Pretty quick. Potentially easier compared to databricks. Document all of the experiences and send it to Anj and Databricks leadership. Only works if we decide to use their genai solutions.
