# Top of Mind
- Finish I9 form
- Finish AlixPartners onboarding and training
- History 7B Discussion post by Wednesday
- IEOR 130 follow up
- Apply for CS 188
- Figure out who is coming from LA for National CHYK retreat
- Influential sephora application export 5

# Work Tracker
## AlixPartners
- Modified Schema: Added metric_type field, changed performance_metrics_exist field to include an uncertain value, modified units enum
- Modified Prompt: Trying to make it clearer for the LLM to figure out which pages are truly RPMs
- Centrum RPM Sheet:
  - Page 3: Learning cost per participant is incorrect. Currency units with K aren't being converted. % EB+ Not getting registered
  - Page 6: Prompt engineer matching symbols to the correct company on a lineplot. Still struggling with that. Have to have a fallback for the job function in case that's not explicitly listed. In  this case, this should be MarComms. 
  - Page 7: Make sure that the values are ordered properly. If a value is incorrectly specified, it should instead be null. This one is really problematic.
  - Page 11: Sometimes the current value can be outside of the lineplot completely. Make sure to ignore the median values. Fixed in second iteration!!
  - Page 12: This one is still problematic
  - Page 13: This one worked correctly even though the current values were outside of the range

### Prompt Engineering Advice
Your prompt is quite comprehensive and provides a detailed structure for the task. Here are a few key considerations and questions that might help improve its effectiveness:

Metric Identification:

How will the system identify and distinguish between different types of metrics (e.g., financial vs. operational)? Should specific keywords or visual cues be emphasized more?
Contextual Information:

Since the documents might contain contextual information that could be helpful for extracting the correct metrics, should there be any emphasis on considering nearby text or annotations to verify the metric's accuracy? This might help in cases where the metric values are ambiguous or the bounds aren't clear.
Error Handling:

How should the system handle scenarios where the metric is missing one or more elements (e.g., a missing bound or unit)? Would it be beneficial to include instructions for what to do when certain data points cannot be extracted reliably?
Confidence Scoring:

Is there a specific threshold for the confidence score below which a metric should be flagged for manual review? Defining this might help the AI system make more nuanced decisions about uncertain extractions.
Job Function Mapping:

How should the system handle cases where the job function doesnâ€™t perfectly match any enum value? Should there be guidelines for approximating or selecting the closest match?
Handling Non-Standard Formats:

If there are non-standard formats or unexpected visual structures in the images (like non-traditional graphs or merged cells in tables), how should the system adapt? This might require a fallback strategy or a separate module to deal with such cases.
Multi-Page Documents:

If there are multiple pages in a document, should the AI treat each page independently, or should it consider information across pages to improve the extraction accuracy? For example, information on one page might clarify ambiguities on another.

### Training
Completed.

## Influential
### Sephora
- Ran Sephora script on the new data dump, waited for Kat's approval to append to the sheet. 
### Semantic Search
- Waiting for Sagar to finish ingestion of data into the vector store
### Summarization
- Test out everything that doesn't need an endpoint. Syntax is very different from openAI design. 
- Sagar said data will be ingested by noon. 
- Talked to Anj last week about not taking 3 weeks break. Asked about background check for Sagar and I. 
- If we can update RAG search, test it, and then that could be the first module to move into GitHub.

# Meetings

## Data Science Standup
- Alex: Cippus media, image recognition, demo pro. All three will be done aiming for tomorrow. 3 tables today and the next 2 tomorrow. Last dependencies for search project. 
- Sushant: Test out qdrant semantic search script when Sagar gives the thumbs up. Oversee the next round of sephora applicant rankings since there's a new data dump today. Continuing to set up my local development environment for sagemaker. Function to read large CSV files from an S3 bucket. Start 
- Cyrus: Set up the classification benchmarking pipeline using sagemaker. Run some permissions stuff related to the sagemaker role. Being able to programmatically spin up endpoints has to be tested. 
- Sagar: Progress on getting data model ready, and ingestion of posts and user data. Start ingestion process after this meeting. Sagar has updated all of the Jira tickets. 
- Taylor: Taylor is not in control of Okta. Ask John Lesser about Okta Databricks configuration. 
- Anj: Worked on puppeteer scripts for monitoring. For AWS meeting, the solutions architect should be there. kj
