Here are some things I've noticed regarding my personal relationship with sleep. 
- No one can lie about being tired. Saying "I'm tired" when I'm really not and when I really am are wholly different feelings
- I need enough sleep to be a positive thinker. When I'm in sleep-debt, I go into a [scarcity mindset](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/scarcity-mindset) and often make bad decisions. These bad decisions can compound overtime and further increase my sleep debt
- If I'm doing work for which, for some reason, I  feel like I need to sacrifice volume of sleep consistently, I am truly shooting myself in the foot. Nothing is worth sacrificing consistency, volume, and quality of sleep. 
- I need between 7.5-8 hours of high quality sleep to be at my peak capacity. My peak capacity is defined by highest levels of motivation, discipline, productivity, creativity, interpersonal communication,humility, ability to contemplate in silence, agreeability, and outward joyousness. Since I value these qualities highly in others and therefore myself, I must prioritize sleep above everything. Then I figure things will work themselves out. 
- MINIMAL CAFFEINE AFTER 12 PM NOON.
- More often than not, relaxing shower before bed helps a lot. 
- Waking up earlier comes with the additional benefit of being slightly more motivated than getting a little bit more sleep and waking up later. 
- Doomscrolling is a killer. Analog activities before bedtime are the best way to get into the sleeping mindset. Listening to podcasts or reading a book have served me well.
