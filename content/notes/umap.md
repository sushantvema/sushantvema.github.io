[Documentation](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Uniform Maniforlm Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique which can be used for visualization as well as general non-linear dimension reduction. 

There are three mathematical assumptions about the data:
  1. The data is uniformly distribbuted on Riemannian manifold;
  2. The Riemannian metric is locally constant 
  3. The manifold is locally connected.

> The embedding is found by searcing for a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.
