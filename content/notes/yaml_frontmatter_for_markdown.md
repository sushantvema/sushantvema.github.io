Markdown is the closest you're going to get to raw information ([plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)) without losing quality of life features for information organization.

Apart from the features in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a lightweight [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), it is useful to add metadata about the context and purpose of a document as part of the [frontmatter](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ffec2853-c0e0-4165-a368-339db12c8e4b/) of a document. 

This allows for unique information organization, analysis, and synthetic capabilities you can build easily using bash scripting on your markdown files. I call this "knowledge scripting" 

In the pursuit of scaling up my [[_index|Knowledge Ocean]] and standardizing my future workflow of "knowledge scripting", it is in my best interest to come to a [steady state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state) consensus on what this frontmatter should look like in most, if not all, of my markdown documents. 

This process involves understanding how other text-based platforms treat markdown metadata. I want to create a metadata standard for myself
