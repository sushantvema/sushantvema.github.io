# Meeting with Cyrus and Ryan
- Sagar had some trouble vectorizing the cippus properly
- Using Weaviate for POC. Pick the accounts with 2000 or more posts. 
- All of us are still on the hook for 3300 accounts
- Prioritize 138 accounts and 
- Save those in a delta table
- Let Sagar know 
- Ryan needs to come in and as best possible determine the general vertical for each account. 
- We'll know what content to pick and what is sparse.
- Sushant: Get the template set up and summarization done. 
- Ryan will run tagging on that
- That will be in an internal google sheet
- Sushant will let Cyrus and Sagar know when the 138 is done. 
- We want to get Sagar 138 summaries. Get full verticals down all by end of day today.
