[Hypothetical Document Embeddings - Haystack AI](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hypothetical-document-embeddings-hyde)

The HyDE method is highly useful when:
  - The performance of the retrieval step is not good enough (e.g low Recall metric)
  - Retrieval step has a query as input and returns documents from a larger document base
  - Data (documents or queries) come from a special domain that is very different from typical datasets which Retrievers are trained on.
