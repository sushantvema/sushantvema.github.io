Mermaid vs PlantUML vs HackerDraw: Which One is Best for You?

# Mermaid
- really easy to setup if VScode. markdown preview mermaid plugin
  - how to do in vim?
- mermaid integrates with markdown, vscode, and notably github
- flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, gantt charts, etc
- mermaid live editor as well. 
- Each of the diagram types don't have many configuration settings
- some control of the layout of the diagram but pretty limited. 
- can't easily modify where boxes and stuff will be rendered. 
- syntasx is not always easy to remember. 
- different syntaxes for arrow types per diagram....

# PlantUML
- install plantuml plugin for vscode and markdown integration
- requires a server to create the plantuml diagrams. go into vscode settings, select how you want to render the diagrams. in order to use local have to setup java and graphviz...
- Since it renders as an image, you will have limited resolution
- website looks super spammy with ads lol. decent documentation
- use case diagrams, json data viz, network diagrams, etc
- existed for a long time. language and tools are pretty standard. 
- plantuml is by far the most flexible. 

# HackerDraw
- new tool on the block
- web-based drawing tool, very easy
- can embed diagrams in notion and confluence
- potential alternative to draw.io (simplicity)
- great database schema tool. prefer this over entity relationship diagram
- cons: limited types of diagrams. drawing, sequence diagram, database schema, markdown map
- doesn't directly integrate with vscode
