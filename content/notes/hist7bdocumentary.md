# Part 1 - Fight No More Forever
- 1871. Nespers in Oregon. 75 years of peace. Joseph had never signed a peace treaty. "Always remember your father never sold this country." A man who would not love his father's grave is as worse as a wild animal. 
- 1874 railroads. Lots of homesteaders. Federal government started consolidating control. 
- Government continued to prosecute the Mormons. Forced countless tribes to surrender and confined to reservations. 
- 1874-1877. Last stand to remain free. Unlikely US army made of immigrants, fugitives, and outcasts. 
- Where thunder resounds more than other places. Seen as the place of deities. Zion?
- Lakota. Black Hills. Soldiers wanted to find a site to build a fort. Unofficially looking for gold. George Custer quote. 9:25. 
- 23 years old, youngest general in the army. Led the charge at Gettysburg. 
- Quote: "Oh if you can see some of the charges that we made. I gave the command: forward. And I've never seen a prettier sight. While thinking of them, I cannot explain: glorious war." His judgement would be called into question, but no one would question his courage. 
- Cheyenne admired him for his courage. Accidentally shot his own horse in the head in the pursuit of a buffalo. Had to be rescued by his own men. In 1868 he mounted a surprise attack against the Cheyenne that solidified his reputation as an Indian fighter. 
- Killing a grizzly bear was the highest level of fame. Also found a little gold. 
- Quote: "From every corner of the country, gold-hungry whites poured in." 13:43.
- Miner's invasion violated Fort something treaty of 1868. 
- So many times the Indians were promised they could keep the land. The whites called it the "Freedom Trail" while the Lakota called it the "Thieves Road".
- Sitting Bull was who they looked for guidance. Scorned those who depended on the US government to feed them. "The whites will get me at last as they say. But I will have good times till then." 17:00.
- No one had earned a greater reputation for bravery. 
- Sitting Bull sat in the middle of the battle field, smoked a pipe, then walked away. 
- 1875: 15000 miners in the Black Hills. Growing numbers made it politically impossible to keep them separated. Commission sent to renegotiate the treaty. 20000 Lakota came. They wanted much much more than 6 million dollars. Sitting Bull wasn't even going to entertain this sale. 
- Washington ordered all the chiefs to come into the reservation headquarters by 1876. Sitting Bull refused. 

## Hard Times
Extremely cold winter. Policing 2.5 million square miles of land between Missouri and Eastern Sierras. Expected to defend settlers, miners, railroad crews, etc. Army pay was low, just $13 a month. Immigrants and drifters. 
- "Some of the recruits would no doubt have served. I sure wonder that some went back to their prisons for better treatment". 13th infantry. 
- These soldiers lived for news from home. Mail is the only connecting link. 
- Army food was unpalatable and indigestable. Whiskey was the soldiers curse. 40/1000 hospitalized for alcoholism. 80 killed themselves. Disease was the worst. Cholera. Most soldiers never met an indian in battle. 24:45.

## A Good Day to Die
- Spring of 1876. Sitting Bull climbed to a hilltop seeking a vision. Vision of a dustcloud on top of a village. 
- General Philip Sheridan drew up plan to route Sitting Bull. 
- June 6: 3000 Lakota and Cheyenne camped out along the river. Most savred ritual. Sun dance. Sitting Bull slashed his arms 100 times as a sacrifice. Another vision. 
- June 17th: A column stopped to brew coffee on a river. Suddenly crazy horse and more than 500 people rode down on them. Some of the army column had scouts from rival tribes. Crooke withdrew the next morning. 
- Celebrated victory for 6 days. The Little Big Horn stream. 
- June 21st. Custer met two dudes. Didnd't know about Crooke's retreat. "Custer, don't be greedy. Wait for us."
- Custer was overzealous to attack them. 
- Custer went a different route. Outnumbered 4:1. Custer's men were stunned at the sight of hundreds of warriors. 
- All of the men in Custer's command were slain. 
- Girl I left behind on guitar is beautiful. 
- Americans were celebrating 100 years of independence in 1868. News of Custer's defeat was greeted in utter disbelief. 
- Sitting Bull took refuge in Canada. General Alfred Terry went to him with an official pardon in return for settling on a reservation. 
- 130000 latter day saints settled in the desert territory. Communal economics, polygamy, one-party politics all by the church. New law gave federal courts power in Utah over the church. Trying to reduce his power over the people. Arrested John D Lee and put him on trial for murder. 
- Brigham Young tried to protect John D Lee. Sent him to exile near the Grand Canyon. Prosecutors offered money and leniency to implicate others. "This people is a misrepresented and cried down community." Orders went out that no Mormons would testify. John D Lee was made to become the scapegoat. Now the entire Mormon jury convicted him. Could choose to be shot, hanged or beheaded. "I studied to make this man's will my pleasure for 30 years. See now what it has come to this day."
- 5 months later, Brigham Young was suffering from illness. 
- Quote by Jedediah M Grant. 59:30

## Good Words
- Most converted to Christianity. Pivoted to farming. 
- Chief Joseph. Promised his father he would never sell his homeland. 
- General Oliver Howard. Ran the Freedmen bureau. Founded Howard University for Blacks. Became convinced Indians were right about the treaty. "I think it is a great mistake to take the land from these guys."
- Gave an ultimatum to Chief Joseph for him to move to Idaho reservation. 
- "We had many grievances. But I knew that war would bring more."
- Howard calls for more troops after huge defeat against Joseph almost 1 year after Custer's Last Stand. 
- Tracked the Nesperts to the Big Hole with help of scouts. Nesperts went to Yellowstone plateau. 
- Stopped at Bear Paw. Colonel Miles and people pushed his guys from Eastern Montana.
- Colonel Mile's promise. Jospeh and people were sent down on a river boat. Mile's promise had been overruled by General Sherman. Adbstained from scouting, let captive women go free, fought with scientific skill. Should never again be allowed to return to Oregon.
- Joseph and people were going into exile in Oklahoma. 2000 miles away. Unsanitary conditions. Scare medicines. Set aside cemetary solely for babies. 
- Old man named Daytime Smoke. Half-Indian son of William Clark. "Good words do not last long. Good words do not pay for my dead people. They do not pay for my country. Good words do not get them a home where they can live in peace and take care of themselves. It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and promises."
