Oil pulling is a simple yet very powerful technique that will result in stronger over-all health and provide an increase of vigor and vitality. It is simply swishing about a tablespoon or so of oil around your mouth, teeth and gums for 15 – 20 minutes ‘pulling’ the oil through the teeth, then spitting the oil out. Practiced since ancient times as a part of Aryuvedic medicine, practitioners believe that oil pulling expels toxins, pathogens and heavy metals from your body, resulting in a stronger over all system and more vibrant health.

Aryuveda, or Aryuvedic medicine, is a system of natural healing that originated in the Indian sub-continent around 5000 years ago. Translating roughly to ‘knowledge of life’, Aryuveda is one of the oldest healing sciences in the world along with traditional Chinese medicine.

One of the beliefs in Aryuvedic medicine is that your health, energy, wellness and vigor depend on a balance between your body, mind and spirit. They believe that it is from imbalances in the body, which can stem from things such as toxins, pollutants or even physical or mental traumas, from which the roots of disease and illness spring.

Called _Kavala_ in Aryuvedic texts, oil pulling is purported to aid in curing and treating a litany of illnesses, including insomnia, tinnitus, easing sciatica, promoting heart health and improving circulation. It is said to prevent tooth decay, to cure gingivitis, prevent and cure illness caused by bacteria and pathogens, strengthen the tissues of the gums and the roots of teeth, and even has anti-ageing effects.

There are many mechanisms by which oil-pulling can improve your health. I truly do believe that oil pulling does in fact treat and cure illnesses in the ways suggested in ancient Aryuvedic texts through a chain reaction of sorts.

First, we will go over the astounding effects of coconut oil and why it should be used for your oil pulling.

**Coconut Oil**

Coconut is a powerful and unique gift from nature with some astounding properties and an abundance of uses.

Coconut oil is made up of a unique combination of fatty acids, chiefly a high number of medium-chained-triglycerides (MCTs) which are comprised of lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid among some others.

Due to this powerful combination of MCTs naturally found in coconut oil, it is a highly potent and effective natural anti-microbial. Its anti-parasitic, anti-viral, anti-fungal and kills numerous types of ‘bad’ bacteria. Its also an anti-inflammatory.

The most potent anti-microbial fatty acid in coconut oil is lauric acid. Lauric acid loves to kick the shit out of bacteria and pathogens. Its like a machete wielding murderer in a hockey mask while pathogens are teenage camp councillors on summer break.

Capric acid and caprylic acid also have bactericidal properties, but not as powerful as lauric acid. Lauric acid also [kills the bacteria that causes acne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2772209/). In fact, lauric acid is about **fifteen times more effective** at killing bacteria _Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes than the harsh chemical agent benzoyl peroxide._ Its cousin [capric acid does the same](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24284257/), but to a lesser degree. Coconut oil even [prevents hair damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12715094/).

In this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5109859/), researchers discovered that coconut oil was just as effective as chlorohexidine mouthwash for killing the bacteria _Streptococcus mutans, which causes dental cavities. Remember, coconut oil is all natural and has no side effects, while chlorohexidine can alter your sense of smell._

_In_ [another study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25838632/)_, researchers found very strong evidence in favor of oil pulling with coconut oil. From the study:_

_“Four researchers in their study involving 60 adolescents of age 16–18 years with plaque induced gingivitis, observed statistically significant reduction of plaque and gingival indices upon oil pulling using coconut oil. Subjects performed oil pulling in early morning at empty stomach in addition to their routine oral hygiene measures such as brushing and flossing. They were assessed after 4 h after performing oil pulling. Modified Gingival Index and plaque index by Sillness and Loe were measured at baseline and on days 1, 7, 15 and 30. Steady decline in indices was found from day seven. Plaque and gingival indices significantly decreased after 30 days of oil pulling. The study observed 50% decreases in gingival and plaque indices after four weeks which is comparatively similar to results produced by chlorhexidine. They concluded that oil pulling with coconut oil is helpful in decreasing plaque formation and plaque induced gingivitis_.”

Here is yet [another study](https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJMR/article-abstract/21CA7A911094) showing a marked reduction in cavity causing bacteria after an oil pulling regime in which sesame oil was used. The researchers mentioned that toxins and bacteria from the body may be removed through the tongue and get trapped in oil and then thrown out when you spit the oil out.

If that isn’t enough to convince you to start oil pulling, there is much more.

An overgrowth of harmful bacteria and an imbalance in the oral microbiome can have dire consequences. The overgrowth of harmful oral bacteria is linked to an increased risk [of cancers later on](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87600-5). Apparently, there is a strong link between pancreatic cancer and negative changes in your oral microbiome. Furthermore, there is [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15907554/) that shows candida overgrowth affects most cancer patients – unchecked candida growth is like a mold or fungus growing in you. It will cause massive damage to the organism infected. Guess what [kicks the shit out of candida](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17651080/)? A plus if you said coconut oil.

When you consume coconut oil and its ample, brain boosting medium-chained triglycerides, you are also consuming the lauric acid. This then gets converted by your body to monolaurin, an even more powerful anti-microbial agent. Monolaurin is effective at killing and destroying numerous bacteria and pathogens. It essentially destroys viruses by disintegrating the lipid or fatty coating that envelopes certain viruses.

What does coconut oil, its unique fatty acid content and monolaurin all combined kill and treat?

- Taken topically and internally, coconut oil can be used to help treat viral infections such as herpes virus and cold sores.
- Evidence it [fights](https://naturepacific.com/contents/en-us/d170_virgin-coconut-oil-AIDS-HIV.html) the HIV virus.
- Kills the bacteria that cause staph infection, streptococcus (which can cause meningitis), and dental carries
- Kills thrush, candida, and the bacteria that causes ringworm
- Kills gingivitis, H. Pylori, S. mitis. May prevent parasites such as giardia.
- [Kills clostridium difficile](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24328700/), an anti-biotic resistant bacterium that causes diarrhea.

In addition to all this, coconut oil does not appear to have any negative effect on beneficial oral or gut bacteria.

Here is the mechanism, besides the anti-microbial effect of the oils, behind how oil pulling is so effective:

The microorganisms inhabiting your oral cavity are single cell and they are covered with a fatty or lipid membrane. This fatty membrane ‘sticks’ to the fat from the oil. They adhere to each other. The oil literally pulls microorganisms, bacteria and potential pathogens from your mouth. When you oil pull, you are swishing and moving that oil around for a good 15-20 minutes. The oil gets into all the nooks and crannies. It will get between your teeth, in microscopic holes and indents, and help clean out and eradicate harmful flora and candida.

In animals, humans included, your oral health is a reliable window into your over-all health. You can glean much information from the teeth and jaws of ancient skeletons. Poorly developed teeth, dental carries and plaque are signs of a poor diet and nutritional deficiencies in ancient skeletons. If someone has a strong, healthy mouth and teeth, no sores, inflammation, cavities or legions and a healthy oral microbiome, they are most likely healthy in other areas. If you have tooth sensitivity, terrible breathe, cold sores, pain, inflammation and continuous problems with your mouth and teeth, your whole system is suffering for it. It will affect everything.

Poor oral health will have rebounding effects throughout your [entire system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88948/). There is strong evidence to support the claim that the risk heart disease and development of atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries from plaque buildup, causing poor circulation, erectile disfunction and more) are [linked](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8910831/) to your oral health.

Periodontal disease, and an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria (which coconut oil all kills) is a [risk factor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29460534/) in endocarditis, an inflammation of lining of your heart’s chambers and valves. It is caused by bacteria from somewhere else in your body, usually the mouth, attaching to parts of your heart.

Funny, remember how the ancients said oil pulling is good for circulation, among numerous other systemic diseases? I love it when ancient practices and modern science click.

A piece of anecdotal evidence from your esteemed sensei, Warrior Primal:

In the ancient past during my younger years, I spent months traveling around Asia. I trained with many different people, tried all sorts of foods from a variety of vendors and markets, swam in not so clean moats, and certainly didn’t soak my hands in harsh sanitizer every time someone so much as looked at me. What I did do, however, is swallow a big ole shot or two of organic, virgin and cold pressed coconut oil every morning, followed by 15-20 minutes of oil pulling. I didn’t get sick the entire time. No ringworm. No food poisoning, diarrhea, nothing. Getting sick, diarrhea and being kicked in the stomach by food poisoning, and skin rashes (ringworm, staph) from training mats are very common for travellers doing such things, and many of my companions were struck by bouts numerous times, none of whom drank coconut oil or oil pulled. Much of the time we were eating and doing the same things. I believe I was spared from illness by the anti-microbial effects of coconut oil, the ‘detoxification’ of oil-pulling, and the powerful monolaurin made by the body from the oil.

Your oral microbiome affects your gut microbiome, which affects your entire being. Having poor oral health will sap energy from you, draining you of vital life force. Your immune system and cells are engaged in a low-grade war, constantly fighting off the bacteria, pathogens and candida trying to grow. Adding in coconut oil and oil pulling to your regime will have a beneficial rebounding effect on your overall health, energy and vitality.

When choosing a coconut oil – Organic, virgin and cold pressed is best.

Take about a tablespoon of oil, let it melt if it isn’t already, and gently swish and pull it all around your mouth. Try to cover all your gums and teeth with the oil as you swish it around. When you are done, spit it in the garbage and not the drain so it doesn’t clog your pipes.

Oil pulling and utilizing coconut oil is a powerful habit and excellent preventative measure to keep you healthy.

> Thank you for sharing this knowledge! I'm convinced already and to know the extra benefits is amazing. I have soft teeth due to genetics. I brush, floss, and use the expensive mouth washes. Still I will get a abscess at least three times a year. It's horrible. But since I started oil pulling that has all changed. A huge difference already!! Thank you!
