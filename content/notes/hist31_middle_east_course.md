## Questions:

- Did the surrounding Arab states really defend the interests of the Palestinians or were they in it for themselves?
- What role did the British play in setting the stage for the events of 1948?
- What was the role of the Zionist movement in the mandate government? Did they work with the British?
- What does this episode of history show us about nationalism? What is it and what are its consequences?
