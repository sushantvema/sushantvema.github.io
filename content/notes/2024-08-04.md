To think about:
  - September traveling
    - Sai comes back on September 9. Needs to go on the 18th to LA. Jo needs to go on the 17th. so we will probably need to leave on the 16th and stay overnight. 
    - Seattle trip. Ranga finishes his MCAT on the 9th of September. Go Sept 7/8 Weekend and come back on Sunday 15th?
