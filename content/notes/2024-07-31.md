# batch inference
batch_inference notebook remotely launches another one

Notebook spins up and down provisioned throughput. 

Use the same endpoint name for now. Use this process. 

Since there's no scale to zero, we have to be very careful. 

Big Assignment:
  - Refactor the code to work with the provisioned throughput. 
  - Pass those 20 summaries to ryan. 
  - Push 40 summaries on delta table. Logic to not run summaries on completed accounts. 
  - By EOD tomorrow, both of our codes work with provisioned throughput. Either ready to launch tomorrow afternoon or go overnight with monitoring. Or Launch Friday morning and monitor throughout the day.

- Heavily review the cost tomorrow. Jump into the usage stuff tomorrow. Don't look at it too much. Tomorrow look through the day. 

- Cyrus is not purview to discussions about how workspace is expanding. Going to speak with Anj soon. Let us have that conversation
