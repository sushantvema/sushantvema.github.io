# Espresso
> Single shots tend to have between 45 and 75mg of caffeine each. The average is 63 mg. If you're going deluxe and ordering a double, you can expect a caffeine boost of between 70 and 120mg per double shot. – [How much caffeine is in a double espresso? - Two Chimps Roasters](https://twochimpscoffee.com/blogs/how-much-caffeine-in-double-espresso/#:~:text=Single%20shots%20tend%20to%20have,and%20120mg%20per%20double%20shot.)

# V60 Pourover
Dosage:
  - 30g coffee (Fine-medium Grind size)
  - 500mL soft or bottled water (97°C / 206.6°F)

Instructions:

- Rinse out your filter paper with hot water to remove the papery taste. This will also preheat the brewer.
- Add your grounds carefully to the centre of the V60 and then create a well
- in the middle of the grounds.
- For the bloom, start to gently pour **60mL of water**, making sure that all the coffee is wet in this initial phase.
- As soon as you’ve added your water, grab your V60 and begin to swirl in a circular motion. This will ensure the water and coffee are evenly mixed.
- Let this **rest and bloom for up to 45 seconds**.
- Pour the rest of the water in in 2 phases. You want to try and get **60% of your total water in, within 30 seconds**.
- Pour until you reach 300mL total with a time at 1:15. Here you want to pour with a little agitation, but not so much that you have an uneven extraction.
- Once you hit 60% of your total brew weight, start to pour a little slower and more gently, keeping your V60 cone topped up. Aim to have 100% of your brew weight in within the next 30 seconds.
- Once you get to 500mL, with a spoon give the V60 a small stir in one direction, and then again in the other direction. This will release any grounds stuck to the side of the paper.
- Allow the V60 to drain some more, and then give it one final swirl. This will help keep the bed flat towards the end of the brew, giving you the most even possible extraction.
