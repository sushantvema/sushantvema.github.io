# GH Actions x Brickflow Meeting
To gain a deep understanding of your initiative and successfully design a CI/CD pipeline for Databricks workflows using GitHub Actions and Bricks Flow, here are some key questions and topics you should explore:

### 1. **Understanding Bricks Flow Framework**  
   - What are the key components of Bricks Flow?  
   - How does Bricks Flow manage Databricks workflows, and what are its capabilities?  
   - How does Bricks Flow integrate with Databricks clusters, jobs, notebooks, and workflows?  
   - What are the limitations or caveats when using Bricks Flow for CI/CD?

### 2. **GitHub Actions and Databricks Integration**  
   - How does GitHub Actions integrate with Databricks APIs (e.g., for triggering jobs, deploying clusters, managing notebooks)?  
   - What permissions and secrets (e.g., Databricks tokens, AWS credentials) need to be managed in GitHub Actions?  
   - How will you structure GitHub Action workflows for different stages (e.g., testing, staging, production)?  
   - What is the best way to handle multi-stage deployments (e.g., development, QA, production)?

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline Design for Databricks Workflows**  
   - What should the CI/CD pipeline encompass for Databricks workflows? (E.g., testing, linting, notebook validation, packaging Python modules)  
   - How will you handle version control for notebooks, jobs, and cluster configurations?  
   - How will you manage the packaging and testing of any dependencies, such as Python libraries, used in the Databricks jobs?  
   - Will you be using Databricks Repos to manage notebooks, or other tools like dbx for deployment automation?

### 4. **Testing and Validation Strategies**  
   - How will unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests be structured for Databricks workflows?  
   - How will you mock Databricks-specific components like clusters, jobs, and APIs in tests?  
   - What tools or frameworks will you use to automate testing for Databricks workflows?  
   - How can you implement notebook validation (e.g., ensuring notebooks have proper syntax and run without errors)?

### 5. **Deployment and Environment Management**  
   - How will you manage different environments (development, testing, production) in Databricks using GitHub Actions and Bricks Flow?  
   - What strategies will you employ for automated rollback in case of failed deployments?  
   - How will you manage configurations for different environments (e.g., cluster size, job parameters) to ensure consistency?  
   - How will environment variables, secrets, and API tokens be managed securely across environments?

### 6. **Monitoring and Notifications**  
   - What monitoring strategies will be used to detect issues during the pipeline execution?  
   - How will you notify relevant teams (e.g., Slack, email) in case of failed builds, deployments, or tests in GitHub Actions?  
   - How can you set up alerts for job failures or other anomalies in Databricks after deployment?

### 7. **Security and Compliance**  
   - What security measures will you take when handling sensitive data in Databricks during the CI/CD process?  
   - How will you ensure compliance with organizational or regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) during development and deployment?  
   - How will audit logs and traceability be maintained for deployments and changes to Databricks workflows?

### 8. **Performance Optimization and Cost Management**  
   - How will you optimize the use of Databricks clusters to minimize costs while running CI/CD pipelines?  
   - How will you measure and monitor performance of deployed workflows post-deployment?  
   - How can you automate scaling of clusters or jobs to balance cost and performance?

Exploring these topics will give you a solid understanding and allow you to design an efficient and scalable CI/CD pipeline for Databricks workflows with GitHub Actions and Bricks Flow.

## What we need to do
- test locally
- deploy to dev branch
- dev environment cluster
- Want to try that with Sushant, Sagar, and Cyrus databricks workflows. Because they are smaller. 
- Where does GHA come in? 
- Continuous integration process: merging, PR reviews, test cases on merges. 
- When a branch is merged into dev branch, unit test cases should run, should be tagged. Then deployed on dev cluster. QA will come in. Tagged as QA certified. 
- Dev becomes a release branch. Released into staging environment. 
- Unknowns: not many in the CI process. One unknown is the CD process. How can we integrate GHA to do deployment for us. DAB-generated actions.
