# Postmortem

That felt like a terrible interview. I was not prepared. 
- They didn't check the submitted code for the ML/datastructure question
- They asked me pointed questions about the following topics which I waffled about:
  - How would you implement a decision tree algorithm given an input dataset?
  - How would you implement a clustering algorithm given an input dataset?
  - How would you implement a logistic regression algorithm given an input dataset?
  - How would you implement an ML pipeline in Databricks?
  - Why didn't you use databricks vectorizer instead of an off the shelf huggingface vectorizer?
  - Are there any security concerns with open source vectorizers?
  - What is data leakage?
  - When did you graduate Berkeley?
  - How would you find the intersection of two tables in SQL? What about two lists of objects in python?
  - What is your approach to scoping out data structures?
  - What project is most interesting to you and why?
  - Why didn't you use Azure Data Factory? 
  - Why didn't you use OpenAI embeddings?
  - What is your comfort with Jupyter Notebooks?


What I need to improve on:
  - Technical knowledge:


Next Steps:
  - Follow up email:
    - Explain that there is code for the two unsolved hackerrank questions. 
    - Suggest a list of ideas that I curate from chatgpt. 

Wrote a long email. Let's see if Tina forwards it to them.
