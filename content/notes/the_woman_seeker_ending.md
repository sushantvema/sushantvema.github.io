# The Woman Seeker Discussion Questions
## Which woman seeker did Sohamji best connect with. 
- Andal. Without the Vedic terminology, it sounds like mysticism. 
- Liked what Pujya Guruji said at the beginning. The main thing to pay attention to is that they are all seekers. They don't care too much about identifications. These are all pointers not the pointed.
- Vasudeva Khutumbanam

## One observation from The Woman Seeker is that many of the devis remained unmarried (e.g. Janabai) or were mistreated in their marriages (e.g. Mirabai, Mata Rupa Bhavani). Yet we also see karma yoginis who use grihasthashrama as an opportunity to influence and inspire others (e.g. Ahilyabai Holkar) and further their devotion to Bhagavan. How should we correctly interpret this? Why does grihasthashrama sometimes further a Devi's bhakti, and why does it sometimes impede it?bservation of the Woman Seeker is that many of the seekers remained unmarried or were mistreated in their marriaged. 
- Situations that come in our life which are out of our control come from past Karmas. The main thing is how do we face it. 
- In spite of difficulty, they kept on going. 
- Some people had good family lives. People will become philosophical or spiritual when there is trouble in their lives. When things are going well, they will become indulgent. 
- When you have good health, time, and no responsibility, money and resources will be wasted. 
- Woman seekers use positive Grhasthrashama for serving. 
- Hindu Yuva "Sankalpa" conference based on Anandabai Joshiji.

## By reading about these devis from over a large span of time starting from the Vedic age to relatively recently, we notice shifts in general access and opportunity for women to pursue shastric studies. What social, economic, political, or historical factors contributed to the general decline over time in women pursuing shastric studies?
- When you approach with reverence, the subject will open up and reveal its true wisdom. 
- Who brought out the scriptures to the general public. Started with freedom fighters. Goes back to Swami Vivekanandaji. Pujya Gurudev said Bhagavad Gita teaching for all. 
- In Sandeepany, both brahmachari's and brahmacharinis do the stuff. 
- People challenged 1) why he was speaking in English and 2) why he is giving this knowledge to everyone. He was very clear. If the knowledge was benefiting him, it will benefit everyone. 
- For someone to study in Sandeepany alone back then, it was much more difficult. 
- Sharada Priyanandaji. She took a group to Siddabari. Swamiji in Siddabari sent out for excellent North Indian cook. But all of these guys were from the South. 
- "You Ask He Answers". Very powerful instructions for sadhana. 
- Traditionally in monasteries, they separate genders in order to prevent discussion. 
- For rituals: if it is a married couple, wife does not need to do rituals separately. If the wife even participates in ritual, she will get 50% of the merit without doing anything. 
- Today we can appreciate that scriptural study is equally available. 
- We have ourselves to blame. No one else is powerful enough to change our conviction. People lost connection to our roots and went to a different track

## The concept of pativrata is given high importance in Sanatana Dharma, which we can see in the narrations of the itihasas and puranas as well as in the lives of some of the Devis (such as Ahilyabai Holkar). Yet, some Western views misinterpret the concept as subservience among other negative connotations. How should we properly understand the concept of pativrata (and its male equivalent) and the role of the dampati (couple) in Sanatana Dharma?
- Vrata means vow. Pativrata means one who is committed to husband. Works both ways. When a couple enters into Grhasthrashrama. 
- 7 steps taken as promises to live together. 
- Whenever the ego surrenders to an altar, that person gets a lot of spiritual and mental power. This is something that cannot be gained by an indulgent person. Someone who is devoted to husband. That woman becomes a powerhouse. 
- Disciple has to be surrendered to guru. Surrender is not subservience. If the husband does something wrong, she must not pander to him. Pativratya is worshipping God through the husband. Pati parameshwara. 
- In Grhasthrashama, 90% of the time they would spend together. 
- Wife looks at husband as Bhagwan, husband looks at wife as Devi. Looking at a person as just a person is "normal vision". How should a seeker look at people?
- Right from childhood, little girls are considered as devis. What will keep people together is commitment alone. Whenever trust is broken or doubt creeps in, it will start poisoning the relationship. The lemondrop is mistrust. 

## There are many western scholars who interpret many of our stories - be it puranas/itihasas or even historical recollections of our Devis in an unfavorable and unsuitable light. Do we correct these misconceptions and misinterpretations? And if so, with whom and how do we go about this?
- To influence people, a certain position of authority and influence is required. Unless you are at the top of the line, it's very difficult for the voice to be heard. 
- I might not be able to change the world, but at least there are people around me, in my "sphere of influence". Our mind becomes agitated if we go too much into criticism or proving something or someone wrong. 
- Just focus on what is right. You will have a few people around you who will appreciate it and respect you. You can do much better and creative things than arguing with people to change their views. 
- Whenever people come to Sohamji with requests to change something or that someone else should do the work, it will not fly. Every weekend, around 20,000 students attend Bala Vihar. If we can inspire stories in the children and put forth things in the right light. Victimizing Draupadi, criticism of Bheeshma. Swami Aparajitanandaji asked, why did Bheeshma sit quietly when Draupadi was being disrobed. Bheeshma composed the Vishnu Sahasranama. 
- If you have respect for shaastra and reverence for scriptures, try to marry both of those passions. Find the depth and nuance. Science has many assumptions baked into it. 
- Don't mix and match with other schools of thoughts. Focus on Advaita Vedanta. 

## When we live in a world where we see such horrific violence done to women, how do we hold fast to the idea that it's not like this in the scriptures?
- Conversation re. Janabhai in the early chapters. There's such as enormity to her that we almost see a disconnect with the way we treat women today. She embodied so many qualities we typically teach men. Every generation, every decade, every millennium, the society changes. What was the thought process 500 years ago versus now, isn't there a difference? Our way of thinking is influenced by the environment we live in. 
- In groups where the old mindset prevails there are most likely deprived of a guru or someone to realign their thinking. 
- Pujya Gurudev in Bhagavatam give a description about cultures which haven't involved over time. As the tree grows, the bark yields. You have to understand the modern context, but stay connected to the roots. Equality is a value, not an opinion. It should be endorsed by a man of wisdom. 
- On our own, we cannot say that this is how the modern interpretation should be. 

# The Art of Contemplation Q&A
## How can one handle perfection when it comes to starting and continuine sadhana?
- Guruji described a perfectionist. One who is miserable himself and makes everyone around him miserable. 
- Perfectionism means performing at one's own best ability. Not stopping halfway. Being diligent in everything that we do. You need perfectionism in studies. 
- At work, if someone is holding onto that quality of perfectionism, they will grow a lot in their career. Can you deliver a task 100% on time with the best quality?
- The smaller details make all of the difference. The difference between a beginner musician and advanced musician is perfectionism. 

## How does one's experience of surrender change from a statement/thought you say to an actual belief? For example, at a basic level, one can understand why one should surrender the outcome of their actions to God and just do their actions for the sake of the action. But the anxiety of what the results may be can be so strong - how does one get to the point where they can surrender?ow does one's experience of surrender change from a state of thought you say to an actual belief?
- Unless one knows about who he is surrendering to, it is difficult to wrap your head around. There are many good things in life that have happened to us. It's easy to take them for granted. 
- The more that we analyze, we realize it is not only my effort that led to my success and good will. 
- Bhagwan, I'm putting forth effort, but I need your grace. 
- Life is not only about me and the world. There is some entity which is constantly working. Sometimes I get more than what I worked for, sometimes I get less than what I worked for. 
- Anxiety is a strange thing. Sometimes you don't know where it is coming from, but it will just be there. 
- All things get convoluted, and anxiety is gone. 
- Strength of his own life, strength of daily pictures, listening to kadhas of Bhagwan. 
- Gopika Geet. Some people get anxiety when they forget about God. Some people get anxiety over material things. 
- For the one who feels like they need God, Bhagwan is not that far away. If we feel like we can live without God, small small things will make us feel anxious. Nothing is really in our control, but we cannot live in fear. Hold on to the one who is actually in control. 
- Will be starting with Vivekachoodamani from the 26th.
