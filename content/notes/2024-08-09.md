Get benchmark unit of time. Run it outside of the notebook. Run benchmark amount with 

100 to 500. At 500, we extrapolate. 500 is a good number. 

15 hours and 2500 to 7 hours and 1200 dollars. Reduce to 3-3.5 hours to 600 dollars. 5-7 hundred dollars

Shouldn't be using memory optimized. Compute optimized is way cheaper. 

Not recommended to autoscale 

Can we write temp files in remotely-launched notebook. 

Having lots of workers with joins isn't efficient because there are lots of shuffles required.
