# 1-1 Meeting with Anj
- This morning at 7:30 I attended a qdrant tech talk discussing agentic workflows with qdrant. Will have a writeup to share the team by EOD. Applications include:
  - Nearest neighbors classification for text and image modalities. 
  - Anomaly detection.
- Didn't push for feedback with Anj about Full time offer.
  - I gave him a high range for starting salary. 140-160k. Flexible. 
- Asked. Haven't heard anything positive or negative from Publicis or budgeting team. Will know January first week or second week.
- Epic, story, and the task.
- Next big thing is improving the search performance. 
- Demo 1: Youtube Video Transcriber
- Demo 2: Structured Data Extractor
- more campaigns have to invest in technology. 
- record the videos and send them out.
