## Data Standup
- Cyrus: Sephora Project. Data munging and manipulation will be the most timestaking thing when we get the first data dump on August 19
- Sushant: Finishing evaluation
- Ryan: Search metrics
- Alex: Incremental ETL processes are being tested. Grabbing 24 hours of data and proper start and end times. Will consult Ryan if help is needed. Discovery on Changed Data Capture is going well. There are some notebooks in Databricks channel with examples to handle live streaming data. Once changed data capture is set up, we can start updating all of our different notebooks. 
- Cyrus: Stick to Spark approaches. Spark has a streaming function which itself is able to identify the last point when the new record was read. There are checkpoints that are created. 
- Alex: S3 to Delta uses structured streaming and checkpointing and only processes new files.
