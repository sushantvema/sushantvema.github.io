> The name Sushant is of Indian origin and is commonly used as a masculine given name.
The meaning of the name Sushant is often interpreted as "calm" or "peaceful" in the Sanskrit language. It is derived from the combination of two Sanskrit words: "su" meaning "good" or "well" and "shant" meaning "calm" or "peaceful." üïâÔ∏è

I believe in "plaintext everything", but sometimes it's nice to see the plain things nicely. 

Hi! My name is Sushant. I don't know what to put here that will truly represent who I *think* I am. But I will this introduction area will reach some sort of steady state in the future.

Minimizing the friction between typing words in a file to scrolling a rendered website allows me to try to be more authentic and creative. Sometimes I struggle with my self-doubt and clearly communicating my thoughts. I believe that the process of voyaging through, organizing, and presenting my knowledge in this ocean will help me regain my bearings. 

I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Data Science from UC Berkeley. Outside of a few internships, I started my career this summer at a Junior Data Scientist at [Influential.co](https://influential.co/), where I get to mess around with large language models and quite a bit of data genereated from influencers small on large on a variety of platforms. 

This ocean will primarily focus on technical knowledge (AI/ML, Programming, Neovim, etc), hopefully some writing (a stab at poetry, reviews of media I consume, reflections on different phases of life and my goals), and general notes about self-improvement. 

I like the idea of [static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)  because they give us an easy and widely-accessible way to connect with others and receive (hopefully) positive reinforcement.

This summer (2024) I'm writing some notes on [[computer_security|Computer Security]]. I'm also studying computer architecture, numerical analysis, and building LLM applications for production. Personally, I have a great interest in UNIX-based design, terminal-centered workflows/productivity, and cooking. Come to think of it, I have a lot to share with the world. I'll be synthesizing my knowledge on these topics daily and bringing them forward to the landing page here once they're ready. See you around! ü´°
