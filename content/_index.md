> The name Sushant is of Indian origin and is commonly used as a masculine given name.
The meaning of the name Sushant is often interpreted as "calm" or "peaceful" in the Sanskrit language. It is derived from the combination of two Sanskrit words: "su" meaning "good" or "well" and "shant" meaning "calm" or "peaceful." 🕉️

I believe in "plaintext everything", but sometimes it's nice to see the plain things nicely. I'm grateful to the [gh/jackyzh0/quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project for providing me such a beautiful medium for expression.

Hi! My name is Sushant. I don't know what to put here that will truly represent who I *think* I am. But I am sure that this introduction area will reach some sort of steady state in the future.

> It'll take a while for my to properly index my landing page, but there are many many notes I'm working on scattered throughout the ocean. I encourage you all to liberally use the Search function. The hotkey is `Command + K`. Additionally, most, if not all, of the notes I've currently published are [tagged and indexed here](https://sushantvema.github.io/tags/).

Minimizing the friction between typing words in a file to scrolling a rendered static site with copious internal and external links lets me be authentic and creative. Sometimes I struggle with self-doubt and clearly communicating my thoughts. The process of voyaging through, organizing, and presenting my knowledge in this ocean will help me regain my bearings in a world where so many rising tides contend to sweep me off of my feet.

I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Data Science from UC Berkeley. Outside of a few internships, I started my career this summer at a Junior Data Scientist at [Influential.co](https://influential.co/), where I get to mess around with large language models and quite a bit of data genereated from influencers small on large on a variety of platforms. 

This ocean will primarily focus on:
  - technical knowledge (AI/ML, Programming, [[foss|free and open-source software]], Neovim, etc), 
  - hopefully some writing (a stab at poetry, reviews of media I consume, reflections on different phases of life and my goals), 
  - and general notes about self-improvement.

I like the idea of [static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)  because they give us an easy and widely-accessible way to connect with others and receive (hopefully) positive reinforcement.

This summer (2024) I'm writing some notes on [[computer_security|Computer Security]]. I'm also studying computer architecture, numerical analysis, and building LLM applications for production. Personally, I have a great interest in UNIX-based design, terminal-centered workflows/productivity, and cooking. Come to think of it, I have a lot to share with the world (maybe represented by the [[subreddits|insanely long list of subreddits I'm subscribed to]]). 

I've recently started to being a [[coffee|coffee snob]], get back into [[books|reading]], and starting my [[calisthenics|calisthenics]] journey.

I'll be synthesizing my knowledge on these topics daily and bringing them forward to the landing page here once they're ready. See you around! 🫡
