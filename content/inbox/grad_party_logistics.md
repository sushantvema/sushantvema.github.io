Contacted lady to supervise 

Called Suchitra aunty. Sarayu's party was in Wave. They called 120 people, 100 people + catering + DJ, it was cramped. Okay, little bit cramped. Need some more space because of mixed demographics. 

The supervising lady has to acknowledge the mail and phone call that Amma did. Civic center person told Amma to write a specific email referencing her name. Just now. 

Insurance is probably not the same for both venue. 

1) I need to check photos for this place
2) I need decide number of hours to book
3) Look at parking
4) Book the venue
5) Call people
6) Send evite
7) Research event decorators
8) DJ - Shivansh
9) MC - one of my friends?
10) Choice of games

As long as you show signs of cleaning up, we can get one hour buffer. 

10 days advance notice for catering. 

> [!NOTE]
> Service people might be including in the capacity.
