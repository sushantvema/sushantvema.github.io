> Enable data, analytics, and AI use cases on an open data lake.

Azure Databricks is a fully managed first-party service that enables an "open data lakehouse" in [[microsoft_azure|azure]]. 

As per usual with Databricks, we get:
  - lakehouse on top of an open data lake
  - analytics workloads while allowing for universal data governance
  - Enablement of data science, data engineering, machine learning, AI, and SQL analytics

A key benefit with Azure Databricks being a managed first-party service is its tight integration with Azure support services.
