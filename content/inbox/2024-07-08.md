Yesterday evening I read some interesting articles about RAG and other topics. Here's my reading list:
  - [Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique Through Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11511) 
  - [RAGAS: RAG ASsessment](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/)
  - [A Real-time Retrieval System for RAG on Social Media Data](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/a-real-time-retrieval-system-for)
  - [Summary: Searching for Best Practices in Retrieval Agumented Generation](https://ssawant.github.io/posts/Best%20Practice%20RAG/BestPracticeRAG.html)
  - [Advanced RAG: Increase RAG Quality with Colbert Reranker and Llamaindex](https://www.pondhouse-data.com/blog/advanced-rag-colbert-reranker)
  - [Advanced Retrieval: Extract Metadata from Queries to Improve Retrieval](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/extracting-metadata-filter)
  - [confident-ai/deepeval : The LLM Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)
  - [Prompt Decomposition: The missing piece to scaling generative AI](https://medium.com/@flux07/prompt-decomposition-da646f0257f1)

## Thinking about Processes and Architecture

- It's clear that we need to create a dataset
- Thinking about Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) makes it obvious to me that we need to define what exactly a document is that we're retrieving. 

## Relevant Confluence Documents for my Work

[AI Profile Summarization POC](https://influential-team.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=372211716&draftShareId=cc3d5695-82b5-4be9-9517-d3e9207ee390)
- What will this document contain?

[AI Summarization Demo Results](https://influential-team.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS1/pages/374636563/AI+Summarization+Demo+Results)
- This page will have versioned demo "outputs" as subpages with some documentation as to what improved and when.

[Sample Data Query Documentation for Search 2.0](https://influential-team.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS1/pages/359104513/Sample+Data+Query+Documentation+for+Search+2.0)
- This document will contain the query we are using to pull sample data, as well as design choices surround it.
