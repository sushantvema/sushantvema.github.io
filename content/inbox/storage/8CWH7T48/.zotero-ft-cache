CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose and Intent
The Purpose of the Mountain House Specific Plan III (SP III) is to provide a long-range comprehensive
plan for future development of approximately 816 acres within the 4,784-acre Mountain House Master
Plan (Master Plan) community. To achieve this, SP III establishes the land use development guidelines
to direct future development and ensure a balance between growth and infrastructure. SP III additionally
includes specific zoning and development standards, and public facilities plans that implement the Master
Plan’s goals, objectives, policies and standards. Mountain House SP III is the third of three Specific Plans
that will implement the Master Plan.
The Master Plan provides the overall development framework for a new community offering a desirable
environment for living and working. Primary goals call for a balance of jobs, affordable housing, and
services to establish a self-contained community; reduction of single-occupancy vehicles through transit
and efficient land use and circulation design; and a strong emphasis on residential neighborhoods
organized around local schools and parks. Furthermore, the Mountain House community will finance and
provide its own public services and utilities resulting in no adverse economic impact to San Joaquin
County.
In conformance with the procedure laid out by the County for development of new communities, SP III is
consistent with the goals, objectives, land use assumptions, requirements and policies laid out in the
Master Plan, as amended. SP III fully implements the Master Plan for the SP III Planning Area.
SP III is intended to accomplish the following:
• Establish the land uses, development standards, and zoning for development;
• Provide the Special Purpose Plan for the Neighborhood Center in Neighborhood A/B;
• Provide detailed plans for infrastructure and services to support these land uses, and provide for
efficient extensions to other neighborhoods within Mountain House;
• Provide a full range and diversity of housing types and costs;
• Ensure that environmental resources are protected, and potential environmental impacts are
adequately addressed;
• Describe implementation measures including phasing, service provisions, and administration of SP III, and
• Provide appendix references of detailed background studies, design guidelines, comprehensive technical regulations, and other resources.

1.2 Planning Context
1.2.1 Location
SP III is located within the southern third of the Master Plan area. It is generally bounded by Mountain
House Parkway to the east, Interstate 205 (I-205) to the south, the Alameda County line to the west and
Grant Line Road to the north, except for a small portion that extends north of Grant Line Road adjacent
to Mountain House Parkway (refer to Figures 1-1: Regional Vicinity and 1-2: Local Setting).

1.2.2 Jurisdictional Agencies
San Joaquin County
The Mountain House new master planned community is located entirely within the unincorporated San
Joaquin County, and development within the community is subject to the San Joaquin County General
Plan 2010 and its implementing ordinances. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65454, a
Specific Plan shall be consistent with the local government’s general plan. The General Plan adopts the
Mountain House Master Plan Land Use Map as the General Plan Land Use Map for Mountain House.
By County policy, a Specific Plan in a new community must also be consistent with the Master Plan and
Public Financing Plan.
Mountain House Community Services District (MHCSD)
The Mountain House Community Services District (MHCSD) was formed to provide various public
services for the community. Most of the MHCSD municipal utilities are provided through contracts or
franchises with public and private entities. These services include water, wastewater collection and storm
water drainage. The remaining services which include refuse collection, telecommunications, telephones,
police, fire, electricity, and gas are contracted out. The MHCSD sphere of influence boundaries are the
same as the Master Plan boundaries.
1.2.3 Planning and Entitlements
Master Plan
SP III summarizes relevant provisions of the Master Plan, as revised. SP III has resulted in numerous
amendments to the Master Plan originally adopted in 1994. These amendments mainly result from the
open space treatment of the major utility easements, the addition of the community college to the plan,
the resulting consolidation of Neighborhoods A and B, and the consolidation of the neighborhood centers.
The Specific Plan is intended to fully implement the Master Plan, as amended, such that a project’s
consistency with the Specific Plan is equivalent to consistency with the Master Plan (refer to Figure 1-3:
Master Plan Designations). Therefore, applicants may utilize this document for Master Plan policies and
implementation measures and refer to the Master Plan and its appendices only as needed for historic
reference and/or supplementary information. If the Master Plan is amended in the future, the Master Plan
summaries within this Specific Plan do not need to be revised.
Other Community Plans and Programs
In addition to SP III and its appendices, the following documents should be consulted by all applicants
preparing submittals for projects as they may contain requirements affecting project design:
• Public Financing Plan (San Joaquin County)
• Mountain House Development Title (San Joaquin County)
• Mountain House Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program and Transit Plan (MHCSD)

Development Permits
After approval of Specific Plans (and Special Purpose Plans, if required), the implementation process
continues with the processing of Development Permits. Development Permits include both discretionary
and ministerial County permits. They include use permits, subdivision maps, and building permits, all of
which must be consistent with this Specific Plan and previously adopted community plans.

........................................................................................................................................................................... 1 - 6 11/22/05
Development Agreements
SP III implementation may include the enactment of Development Agreements which are contracts
between the County and property owners. These contracts would further delineate the rights and
responsibilities of property owners in the development of their property.
Environmental Review
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for SP III was prepared in compliance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, the County prepared an Initial
Study which determined that certain potentially significant environmental impacts might be associated
with development under SP III. The County prepared EIR No. 2003102074 (under separate cover) that
identifies impacts which may result from implementation of SP III and includes recommended mitigation
measures to lessen these impacts.
Controlling Document
SP III along with development agreements for properties within the SP III planning area are the controlling
documents for development within the SP III planning area. The purpose of SP III is to provide more
development detail within the boundary of the Specific Plan as required by the Master Plan and in
conformance with the goals and objectives of the Master Plan, as amended, such that SP III fully
implements the Master Plan for the SP III Planning Area.
When there are conflicts between the Master Plan and SP III, SP III shall govern. The Master Plan and
SP III Development Agreements further reference the authority of SP III. If SP III is silent on a matter
addressed by the Master Plan, the Master Plan shall govern. Where various Mountain House plans or
programs might differ from SP III, SP III and its development agreements shall govern. If SP III is silent
on a matter addressed by other relevant Mountain House plans and programs, the relevant plan or
program shall govern.

MHCSD Ordinances and Standards
The MHCSD was formed since the Master Plan was adopted in 1994, for the purpose of managing,
operating and maintaining the infrastructure serving the community. The MHCSD has adopted ordinances
and standards for public improvements and public services that are intended to apply to development
within the community. Provisions of MHCSD Ordinances and MHCSD Standards for public
improvements apply to all of Mountain House including SP III. These ordinances and standards are
required to be consistent with and implement the Master Plan and subsequent Specific Plans. It is the
intent for the Specific Plan to be consistent with all MHCSD standards in effect at the time of SP III
adoption. If conflicts should be found with previously adopted MHCSD standards, the MHCSD standards
shall govern. If MHCSD adds, revises or amends its standards in the future, such changes shall be found
to be consistent with SP III, and then such standards will govern. A Specific Plan cannot delegate
authority to supersede the Specific Plan to administrative rules to be adopted at a later date.
Development Title and Other Ordinances
Provisions of the San Joaquin County Development Title and other County Ordinances shall apply to
Mountain House except as superseded by Development Standards in Chapter 3 which are to be adopted
by ordinance as part of the County Development Title for Mountain House. Where the Development Title
and various County ordinances might conflict with SP III, SP III shall govern. If SP III is silent on a matter
addressed by the Development Title other relevant County ordinances, the Development Title or other
relevant County ordinance shall govern.
Public Financing Plan (PFP)
The Public Financing Plan (PFP) is a separate document prepared in association with the Master Plan.
The PFP identifies needed public services, facilities, costs and funding alternatives to implement the
Master Plan. The PFP is based upon the policies, land use data, public facility and services standards,
cost estimates and phasing plans identified in the Master Plan.
1.2.4 Property Ownership
SP III includes 65 separate parcels and 54 separate owners at the time of adoption. The majority of these
parcels are located in Grant Line Village (a residential neighborhood containing approximately 50
residences). There are major property holdings as identified by letter in Figure 1-4: Property Ownership.
Table 1-1: Parcel Acreage Calculations by Parcel Number summarizes the land acreages from Figure 1
4: Property Ownership. A table listing the parcels within the Specific Plan is contained in Appendix A.

1.3 Using the Specific Plan
SP III document, which is divided into sixteen chapters, is organized to correspond with the chapters of
the Master Plan. Applicable portions of the Master Plan are included in this Specific Plan for ease of
implementation. Appendices to SP III provide additional technical and background information and are
organized to correspond to the appropriate chapter. SP III assigns preliminary names to streets and other
features of the project. These place names are for working purposes only. Final names will be
determined during the Tentative and Final Map subdivision process.
The sketches, diagrams, and concept plans included in SP III are conceptual and intended to convey the
overall design intent. In order to convey this design intent, the trees and other plants shown in sketches
and cross-sections have been drawn to show their sizes at maturity. Lotting patterns and local street
locations may vary from those shown on the Illustrative Concept Plan (see Figure 4-1: Illustrative Concept
Plan) without need for an amendment to the Specific Plan. However, it is intended that Medium Density
Residential (R-M) areas with small lots, with a standard size of under 3,600 square feet, remain in small
lot configurations and provide a variety of small lot approaches within a neighborhood including: alleys,
green courts, and housing clusters.
The Implementation Measures provided within the SP III document identify the actions that need to be
taken and the requirements for development that are necessary to implement SP III plans and the Master

........................................................................................................................................................................... Revised 11/05/19 2 - 1
CHAPTER TWO: COMMUNITY VISION
2.1 Master Plan Summary
Mountain House is envisioned as a new self-sufficient community offering employment, goods,
services, and recreation. Land use and circulation are designed to encourage walking, bicycling,
and transit use in a highly landscaped, visually attractive community. Mountain House will also
provide a diversity of housing types, employment opportunities and recreational amenities for its
residents. In the tradition of California Central Valley towns, Mountain House is designed as a
community of pedestrian-scaled, tree-lined neighborhoods, each focused on the neighborhood core,
with schools and parks linked to nearby shopping.
2.1.1 Specific Plan III Description
Specific Plan III (SP III) implements the Master Plan goals and objectives, and establishes the
framework for land use and development standards that will govern the community build-out of the
neighborhoods within its planning area. SP III also added a major new land use objective to the
Master Plan to accommodate a satellite campus within the community for Delta Community College.
The Specific Plan also identifies the public infrastructure and services needed to support
development. It defines the permitted uses, development density, building setbacks, building
heights, and other development standards to be utilized for projects in the planning area.
2.2 Master Plan Goals and Objectives
The Master Plan, Sections 2.2 through 2.9, established the following goals and objectives for the
Mountain House community, to be implemented over the years through the development of each
Specific Plan area.
Overall Goals
• Create a high quality environment where people of all economic levels can live and work.
• Develop a distinct and unique new community that is separate from existing communities.
• Develop Mountain House as a community that will accommodate a portion of the growth
projected by the 2035 General Plan for San Joaquin County in an orderly, well-organized
development pattern.
• Provide for a lifestyle that is less reliant on the automobile, more directed towards activities
within the local community and neighborhoods, and more oriented toward the use of transit,
bicycle and pedestrian transport.
Community Character
Create attractive and diverse environments for living, working and playing.

2.3 Specific Plan III Neighborhood Vision
The neighborhood vision for SP III is unique within Mountain House. SP III combines the best aspects
of master-planned development providing a mix of historic housing styles with the landscaping and
open spaces of long-established neighborhoods. The design character is also heavily influenced by
the constraints created by the electrical and pipeline transmission corridors that crisscross the planning
area, which also present the opportunity to use the corridors for an open space and trail system to
serve residents of SP III (see Figure 7-1: Recreation and Open Space Plan).
The area south of Grant Line Road combines Neighborhoods A and B into a single neighborhood,
Neighborhood A/B, with a community college campus, Community Park, consolidated neighborhood
center, and abundant open spaces. Neighborhood A/B has two open space corridors that cross near
the center of the planning area linking its residential areas together with a new school, Neighborhood
Parks and a proposed South Community Park. This provides for an intricate system of pedestrian and
bicycle trails providing safe access to schools and parks with minimal street crossings.
The area of SP III north of Grant Line Road in Neighborhood D is designed to be harmonious with the
community character of both Neighborhood A/B and Neighborhood D which is partially within Specific
Plan II. The distinction for the Neighborhood D component within SP III will be the landscape
enhancement of the power line easement running diagonally through the residential areas. A
neighborhood trail system with tree planting along the perimeter of the easement provides an open
space corridor system that enhances the visual open space character and sense of pedestrian
connectivity in this neighborhood area. The residential and industrial architecture and landscape shall
comply with the standards and conditions specified in SP III, maintaining the continuity of this
community concept.
The Delta College campus will be the focal point of the southwest corner of the planning area. The
College, located on Central Parkway, will be a major educational and recreational resource for the
community. The location of the College at this site led to combining Neighborhoods A and B to provide


Mountain House Specific Plan III
..........................................................................................................................................................................
........................................................................................................................................................................... 2 - 6 Revised 9/11/07, October 18, 2022, May 21, 2024
arterial street access to the College and opportunities for development in the I-205 Mixed-Use area
adjacent to the planned Mountain House Business Park in the SP I area south of Central Parkway.
Consolidation of the Neighborhood Center takes advantage of the open space corridor as a safe walkto-school route, incorporates a common Neighborhood Park located on the open space trail corridor separating the one school, and meets state-mandated school setback criteria from the two crisscrossing, utility, transmission line facilities. The location for the Neighborhood Center was also chosen to allow convenient walking distances to homes and minimize the number of children who would need to cross Central Parkway to get to school.
Central Parkway is designed to be the icon street of the community and is envisioned to be its “parade route”. Acting as a strong community linkage element, the parkway has a distinctive character as it threads through the entire community from north to south. Central Parkway will be dominated by groves of canopy trees with occasional vertical tree species or colorful deciduous trees at nodal or accent points. The character is informal, with heavily shaded street corridors and pathways separated from the roadway by a planted parkway strip.
One key to the success of the community is the appropriate architectural vocabulary and theme. Italianate has been chosen as the design theme for Neighborhood D. A Prairie architecture theme has been established for Neighborhood A and Mission/Spanish Colonial architectural theme has been established for Neighborhood B. The Neighborhood Center in Neighborhood A has been designed to accept one K-8 school. These themes should be reflected in the architecture of some of the homes surrounding the Neighborhood Center. The architectural design of homes within the planning area will exhibit several themes that are compatible with each other.
A variety of housing types, densities and lot sizes will be provided within the planning area to accommodate a diversity of family incomes and lifestyle conditions. Lotting patterns may include standard front driveway lots, corner side driveway lots, cluster lots with common driveway access (courtyards/auto courts), alley lots with garage access to the rear, and lots with common open spaces or green courts with rear alleys. Two medium-high density residential areas, one in the southeastern area of Neighborhood A/B and the other in Neighborhood D along the open space corridor will provide higher density housing opportunities emphasizing pedestrian access and connections. The I-205 Mixed-Use area has been designed to capture the opportunity for higher density housing types in close proximity to the Delta College Campus and the Mountain House Business Park located near the I-205 and Mountain House Parkway interchange. The general density of proposed residential areas of SP III would be slightly higher than the Mountain House neighborhoods to the north and would provide a relatively more affordable neighborhood context.
The “surplus” 62 units from the conversion of the two R-H sites to R-MH are being used in the I-205 Mixed-Use development area as envisioned with the 2007 SP III amendments. The county strongly encourages the inclusion of R-H density in SP III and the new I-205 Mixed-Use area accomplishes this commitment.
The Community Park, which is located to the southwest on Central Parkway across from the
Community College, balances the location of the Neighborhood Center within Neighborhood A/B such
that most homes are within easy walking or bicycling distance to a park. All parks within Neighborhood


Mountain House Specific Plan III ........................................................................................................................................................................
........................................................................................................................................................................... Revised 9/11/07, October 18, 2022 2 - 7
A mix of public and private uses to serve the daily needs of people in the neighborhood is
encouraged within the commercial portion of the Neighborhood Center. A variety of retail uses and
community facilities such as a day care center, recreation building, or meeting hall are allowed.
Outdoor dining areas, pedestrian plazas, and sitting areas are encouraged in the neighborhood
commercial site to emphasize its place as a social center of the neighborhood.
The I-205 Mixed-Use development area on the south and eastern boundaries of SP III intends to
compliment the Delta College Campus and the planned Mountain House Business Park suggested
with SP I. The Mountain House Business Park is planned to have a park-n-ride lot and could
possibly be augmented with a commuter rail platform associated with the planned Valley Link Rail
service. The proposal for the southern end of SP III will promote easy vehicular, transit, bicycle and
pedestrian connections planned with the Mountain House Community.

CHAPTER THREE: LAND USE
3.1 Introduction
This chapter summarizes Master Plan provisions for land use and zoning, including the Specific Plan III Land
Use Plan and Program, land use regulations, Development Standards, affordable housing and jobs-housing
balance, and implementation measures for Specific Plan III (SP III). More detailed design provisions are
located in Chapter Four: Development and Design.
3.2 Land Use Plan and Program
3.2.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan adopted land uses for all areas within SP III and identified approximate acreages for the
land uses as shown on Master Plan Tables 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3. Table 3-2: Master Plan Land Use
Designations in Specific Plan III, of SP III contains the land use categories and use descriptions adopted
by Master Plan. The Master Plan directs that Specific Plans shall establish zoning within Specific Plan
Areas. The Mountain House Development Title zoning designations that implement the Master Plan land
use designations are shown in Table 3-4: Implementing Zones for Master Plan Land Use Designations.
Figure 3-2: Land Use Map and Residential Buildout implements the Master Plan Land Use Map, as
amended. Figure 3-4: Specific Plan III Map Zoning Diagram implements the Land Use Map from a zoning
perspective. Acreage allocations for all zoning designations in SP III are shown in Table 3-1: Land Use
Summery by Neighborhood.
The Mountain House Development Title identifies permitted and conditionally permitted land uses within
Mountain House. SP III identifies permitted and conditionally permitted uses within the SP III Planning
Area. See Table 3-5: Uses – Residential Districts, Table 3-6: Temporary and Accessory Uses 
Residential Districts, Table 3-9: Uses in Commercial, Industrial and Public Districts, and Table 3-10:
Temporary and Accessory Uses – Commercial, Industrial and Public Districts which are adopted by
ordinance to amend the Development Title for the SP III planning area.
3.2.2 Specific Plan III Description
SP III provides for approximately 2,578 residential units, approximately 946,117 square feet of limited
industrial uses, 16 acres of Mixed-Use Development and 250,000 square feet of commercial uses based
on the projected floor area ratios used in Master Plan Table 3-2: Land Use by Neighborhood, one K-8
school, approximately 36.7 acres of neighborhood and Community Parks, and an approximate 107.9-acre
community college with a planned capacity of 12,000 students. See Table 3-1: Land Use Summary by
Neighborhood.
SP III consolidates Master Plan neighborhoods A and B into a single neighborhood (Neighborhood A/B),
centering around a 20 -acre Community Park and a single Neighborhood Center containing a
neighborhood-serving commercial center, a school, and a Neighborhood Park (with both active and


Mountain House SP III

.................................................................................................................................................................................. 3 - 2 Revised 9/11/07, October 18, 2022
passive recreation facilities). The eastern portion of Neighborhood D north of Grant Line Road is also
located within SP III.
A 107.9-acre Delta College campus, which was not part of the original Master Plan adopted in 1994, is
now proposed to be located in the southwest portion of the SP III. The San Joaquin Delta Community
College District (SJDCCD) is planning this new campus to meet enrollment needs in the South San
Joaquin County area over the next 20 years. The campus would be developed in four phases. A joint
use agreement between the Mountain House Community Service District (MHCSD) and SJDCCD will
make available 7.0 acres of college athletic facilities for community use.
The Neighborhood Parks, neighborhood commercial, and elementary schools were consolidated into one
neighborhood center because of the introduction of the Community College; the location of the I-205
Freeway; the presence of two crisscrossing, high pressure gas and oil pipelines, and electrical
transmission easements. The Master Plan requirements that schools not be located on an arterial road
and to minimize the number of students crossing arterial roads further reduced the possible locations for
the schools. Combining Neighborhoods A and B into a single neighborhood allows the schools to be more
centrally located off arterial roadways, minimizes pedestrian crossing of arterial streets and achieves
setback requirements for existing utility easements.
SP III provides for a variety of housing types to accommodate a diversity of family incomes and lifestyle
conditions. The residential units will have densities and sizes varying from medium-high density or high
density units to single family detached, low density homes on 7,000 square foot lots. The general
residential density of SP III will be slightly higher than the Mountain House neighborhoods to the north
and, as a result, will provide a relatively more affordable neighborhood context. The majority of the homes
will be medium density, expected to range from 1,300 square feet to 2,800 square feet on a variety of lot
sizes. Approximately 74% of the housing in SP III will be single family detached and approximately 24%
will be attached condominiums, townhomes, or apartments. It is anticipated that the variety of housing
types proposed, including high density development, will provide housing for the employees of the
industrial park at the corner of Mountain House Parkway and I-205 and Delta Community College and the
other employment uses within Specific Plan III.
The single-family residential portion of SP III north of Grant Line Road (i.e., eastern portion of
Neighborhood D) will be developed with a variety of attached and detached homes generally ranging in
size from approximately 1,300 to 2,600 square feet in the Medium Density and Medium-High Density
categories. While Specific Plan II (SP II) and SP III share Neighborhood D, an Italianate architecture and
common landscape theme ties the neighborhood together with a central focus on its neighborhood center
and a Special Purpose Plan to be developed under SP II.
Open space corridor connections are provided between the neighborhoods and the Community Parks and
other open space corridor areas. These connections consist of a linear park system, multi-use paths,
trails, local streets with sidewalks, and bikeways. Bicycle and pedestrian access are also provided to
community-wide destinations such as Community Parks, community shopping centers, schools, the Town
Center, and churches.

Convenient walking access is provided to the A/B Neighborhood Center with all residential units located
within three fourths of a mile as required by the Master Plan. This Neighborhood Center includes one K
8 school, a Neighborhood Park, a Neighborhood Commercial area, and a transit stop. Except for Central
Parkway, only local or collector streets occur within the neighborhood. Central Parkway is aligned to
provide direct access to the Community College and to minimize the number of students who need to
cross an arterial street to gain access to school. Students living in the residential units located west of
Central Parkway will have to cross Central Parkway to get to school. However, a school bus system will
be provided by Lammersville Elementary School District (LESD) financed partially by the College District.
The one K-8 school is located on separate collector street with additional local streets providing access.
The entrances and building fronts will be oriented onto collector streets to the degree feasible in order to
maximize the civic presence of the school and provide adequate access. Public open spaces and use
front onto public streets to the greatest degree possible in order to give character and beauty to the street.
Open space corridors with pathways link the schools to residential areas allowing students a safe walk to
school with a minimum of street crossings.
Open space corridors include the neighborhood open space corridor system, a variety of perimeter edge
conditions, slope landscape areas in the northwest knoll area, the northwest Neighborhood Park, trail
corridors along the major gas and electricity easements, and most importantly the Community Park which
provides the central recreation and open space corridor for the neighborhood. See Figure 3-2: Land Use
Map and Residential Buildout. All residential areas will be within 1⁄2 mile of a park or open space corridor.

3.2.3 Pre-Existing Development Areas within Mountain House
3.2.3.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan requires that pre-existing residential areas be designated Very Low Density Residential
(R/VL) in the General Plan prior to their inclusion in Specific Plan. The pre-existing residential areas in SP
III are Grant Line Village in the northwest corner of Neighborhood A/B along Grant Line Road and the
Homesite parcels which include 4 homes and vacant land located in the central portion of Neighborhood
A/B. Pre-existing residential areas may connect to public sewer, water, and drainage systems without the
requirement of a Specific Plan, provided the use remains allowable under the AU-20 zone and is
compatible with adjacent urban uses, either existing or planned. The R/VL General Plan designation and
the AU-20 zone may be changed to an urban designation and zone when a Specific Plan is approved for
a pre-existing residential area.

3.2.3.2 Specific Plan III Description
Approximately 50 homes and 45 parcels are in the northwest corner of SP III in an area known as Grant
Line Village. The land use designation for this area is Very Low Residential (R/VL) with a requirement that
a Special Purpose Plan be prepared for Grant Line Village and adopted by the County prior to approval of
any new subdivisions within Grant Line Village. The homes may remain as they currently exist under the
R/VL land use designation and R-VL zoning. Existing legal uses that do not conform to the R-VL rezoning
may continue as legal nonconforming uses under County Development Title requirements. Limited
development that does not involve a subdivision of land may proceed without the requirements for urban
services that are required for all other new development within Mountain House. The Homesite Parcels
have a R/L land use designation and R-L zoning.
SP III provides a minimum 8-foot-wide landscape buffer to the southeast of the existing Grant Line Village
parcels. A roadway located adjacent to the landscape buffer provides additional distance between the
development and Grant Line Village. An masonry retaining wall and/or a good neighbor fence will be
provided along the Grant Line Village boundary with developing lands in SP III.
A two-way, 20-foot-wide frontage road has been proposed on the south side of Grant Line Road adjacent
to Grant Line Village to allow residents to safely access their homes, while also providing a buffer from the
widening of Grant Line Road. This buffer includes five feet of landscape with a sound wall (see Figure 3

etc.) shall be implemented.
3.2.4 Interim Agricultural Operations
3.2.4.1 Master Plan Summary
The Mountain House community was planned to build out over a period of years. Although agricultural
operations will be phased out as development occurs, interim agricultural enterprises should be
encouraged and protected.
3.2.4.2 Specific Plan III Description
To the extent feasible, SP III provides for the phasing of development to allow continuation of adjacent
agricultural operations. Development adjacent to existing agricultural operations shall utilize permanent
setbacks, landscape buffers, fencing or walls to minimize noise, spray drift, and limit the potential for
trespass. Development near and adjacent to existing agricultural operations shall ensure protection of
agricultural water supplies.
3.2.4.3 Implementation Measures

3.2.5 Residential Land Uses
3.2.5.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan provides a density range for each residential land use category that is specifically tailored to the Mountain House new community (see Table 3-3: Neighborhood Minimum, Maximum, and Expected Residential Units). This density range is generally more restrictive than the density range specified in the San Joaquin County General Plan.
The Master Plan establishes a minimum, maximum, and expected number of dwelling units for each residential designation and for each neighborhood. Facility planning will generally be based on a number of units higher than the “expected” number, in order to allow for contingencies. During the review of a Specific Plan adoption or amendment, the number of proposed residential units shall be reviewed with respect to the number of total units planned in the community to ensure that a maximum of 16,105 units, as defined in the Master Plan, will not be exceeded.
Acreage used in residential density calculations excluded the following:
• All arterial street rights-of-way
• Wetland areas identified in the Master Plan
• Non-residential land uses, including uses that may be added at a later date
• Collector streets shown on Master Plan (see Figure 9.4: Roadway Classification Diagram)
Acreage included in residential density calculations consist of the following:
• Local roads and Collectors internal to each neighborhood


Mountain House SP III ..................................................................................................................................................................................
.................................................................................................................................................................................. 11/22/05, 5/21/2024 3 - 13
• Land used in the actual subdivision, including any additional neighborhood open space corridors, median landscaping within local and collector roads, or private recreation areas
To ensure orderly growth and to generally maintain the planned number of residential units within the community, the Master Plan provides a density range for each residential land use category that is specifically tailored to the Mountain House new community. Residential developments (i.e., subdivisions) within Mountain House will need to develop within the minimum and maximum densities permitted for each residential category. A residential subdivision or development may be approved at a density which exceeds or falls below the density range specified by the Master Plan, provided the subdivision is within the General Plan density range; and that the Master Plan density range for each land use district will be maintained for the Specific Plan area.
3.2.5.2 Specific Plan III Description
The majority of housing provided in SP III is single family detached homes within the R-L and R-M zoning
districts. Neighborhoods A/B and D consist of a number of residential sub-areas corresponding to a
subdivision with a common lotting size and or pattern (See Figure 3-2: Land Use Map and Residential
Buildout). These sub-areas within a neighborhood have been designed to provide a clear sense of entry,
edges and center. This is accomplished through the use of landscaping, streetscape design, wall and
fencing treatments, decorative paving materials, signage, or other appropriate elements.
The pedestrian-friendly residential character of the neighborhoods is achieved through maintaining the
sidewalk as the consistent visual and functional element along the street, providing open space corridors
with pathways, encouraging porches facing the street. In addition, development standards and design
guidelines for houses and lots are intended to create varied, interesting residential street environments.
Local streets within neighborhoods are located to disperse traffic and create a comfortable pedestrian
scale. Pavement widths shall be minimized to the extent possible to reduce development and
maintenance costs, discourage speeding, achieve a more pedestrian scale and orientation, and improve
the visual appearance of street corridors. Cul-de-sacs and local streets have been designed to minimize
travel distance to Neighborhood Centers for pedestrians. Pedestrian/bicycle connections must be
provided from local streets and the ends of cul-de-sacs adjacent to arterial and collector streets. Garage
placement on rear alleys is encouraged for homes, fronting school entries. Automobile access to
Neighborhood Centers is via a network of local streets feeding into collector streets leading to the
Neighborhood Center. Paired access drives shall be encouraged to reduce points of traffic conflict on
streets along such areas where alleys are not provided. The streets along the power line easement open
space corridor have been located to provide physical and visual access to one side of the corridor at a
time. It is the intent of SP III to limit the number of road crossings of the open space corridor and trail
system. Two road crossings are planned in Neighborhood A/B, one south of the Community Park and
one north of the Neighborhood Park in order to provide a safe walk to school along the trail for children
within Neighborhood A/B. Emergency vehicle access crossings on the trail are located north of the
Community Park and south of the Neighborhood Center Park.

3.2.5.3 Residential Development and Density
SP III includes a mix of residential housing types to encourage residents with a variety of income levels, providing
diversity and choice for residents. Higher density (R/MH, R/H and M-X) land uses are concentrated near
employment areas, the Delta College Campus, the Mountain House Business Park and the two K-8 schools.
Medium density (R/M) land uses are located in central areas of the neighborhood around schools and the
Community Parks. Low density (R/L) land uses are located in the Homesite Parcels, near the eastern and
western edges of Neighborhood A/B, and adjacent to existing rural residential development in Grant Line Village.
Grant Line Village is designated for very low density (R/VL) residential use. A Special Purpose Plan is required
prior to any new development to implement the R/VL Zone. Standards for residential development surrounding
the Neighborhood Center in Neighborhood A/B are provided in Section 4.3. This section provides the equivalent
of a Special Purpose Plan for this Neighborhood Center.
The single-family residential sub areas provide a variety of densities and lot sizes to promote a mix of
residential housing types, home sizes, and prices that will present diversity and choice for residents
consistent with Master Plan requirements. See Figure 4-1: Illustrative Concept Plan and refer to separate
document for Residential Design Guidelines for potential housing prototypes. Sub area lotting patterns
include standard front driveway lots, corner side driveway lots, cluster lots with common driveway access,
alley lots with garage access to the rear, and lots with common open spaces or green courts with rear
alleys. In order to increase home ownership affordability, medium density residential subdivisions that
include a standard parcel size of under 3,600 square feet are required to have one smaller size home
model with a maximum square footage identified in Footnote 6 of Table 3-7: Lot and Structure Standards
– Residential Districts.
Three Medium-High density (R/MH) residential sub areas are identified, one in the southern area of
Neighborhood A/B at the corner of De Anza Boulevard and Central Parkway and two sites in Neighborhood D
along the power line easement/open space corridor. One High density (R/H) residential and one Mixed-Use
(M-X) planning area has been identified in the I-205 Mixed-Use area south of Central Parkway. Site plans for
medium and multi-family housing will emphasize pedestrian access and connections. A variety of architectural
styles and building types will be provided for multi-family housing. Parking for multi-unit developments will be
designed according to the Mountain House Design manual for Multi-Family Housing projects, the specifications
of this Specific Plan as well as the County Development Code with a parking court concept to minimize large
parking areas and provide parking near individual residential units. Landscape buffers and/or screening walls
adjacent to the car park will be provided.
The residential program for the overall SP III Area is summarized in Table 3-3: Neighborhood Minimum,
Maximum and Expected Residential Units. This table indicates gross acreages for each land use
category, and estimated numbers of dwelling units, population and employment figures. Density and
employment figures are based upon gross acreages, which exclude the following:
• Arterial street rights-of-way.
• Collector street rights-of-way shown on Master Plan.
• Other designated land uses such as Open Space, Public Facilities and Resource
Conservation/Wetland areas.

3.2.5.4 Implementation Measures
a. Residential development for a property shall not exceed the assigned number of units specified in
Table 3-3: Neighborhood Minimum, Maximum and Expected Residential Units, under the column
entitled “Expected units.”.
b. Tentative Maps shall implement the conceptual illustrative plan for residential sub-areas as shown on
Figure 4-1: Illustrative Concept Plan. Lotting patterns and local street locations may vary from those
shown on this figure without need for an amendment to the Specific Plan. However, it is intended that
Medium Density Residential (R-M) areas with small lots, with a standard size of under 3,600 square
feet, remain in small lot configurations and provide a variety of small lot approaches within a
neighborhood including: alleys, green courts, and housing clusters.
c. Tentative Maps for individual parcels shall emphasize pedestrian and bicycle connections within the
neighborhood, between adjacent residential areas and public facilities.
d. Residential development shall exhibit energy efficient, cost-effective subdivision design; optimize the
ability of residences to use solar energy, maximize access from housing to parks, open space corridors
and other amenities, discourage vehicular through-traffic, and shall incorporate applicable Community
Energy Conservation Report (CECR) recommendations.
e. To the extent feasible, homes shall front onto local and collector streets or green courts, except as in
measure “f” below. Direct driveway access to individual homes shall not occur within 30 feet of an
arterial street intersection.
f. Homes shall front or give the appearance of fronting onto Central Parkway, with vehicular access
provided from private auto courts accessed from local streets, rear alleys or streets. A house may
appear to front onto Central Parkway by siding onto it with a porch with front elevation type architectural
detailing facing Central Parkway. No walls are allowed along Central Parkway, except those
necessary to reduce sound levels to 65 decibels (dB) in backyards of lots siding on Central Parkway.
Such walls are allowed only after the houses are first sited and designed to shield noise and reduce
the height and length of the wall.
g. In order to maximize interconnections between all areas within residential neighborhoods, street and
block lengths shall be generally limited to 800 feet for all local streets. A minority of blocks within a
neighborhood may exceed this length, providing that through-block, pedestrian connections occur at
distances no greater than every 500 feet. In instances where proposed locations of through-block
pedestrian connections are determined by the Director or Planning Commission to be in conflict with
the health, safety and welfare of future residents, such connections can be eliminated.
h. Use of rear alleys is strongly encouraged for homes fronting neighborhood centers, schools, parks, or
other important public facilities. Where rear alleys are not feasible in such locations, shared or paired
access drives should be utilized to reduce curb cuts and points of conflict along streets.
i. The visual impact of driveways and garages shall be minimized by such techniques as reducing the
width of driveways; utilizing shared or paired drives; using narrow drives with garages located at the
rear of the lot; utilizing alleys; recessing the front facing garages in the architectural design of the home
and using side entry garages on corner lots. Design Guidelines shall establish minimum and maximum
widths.

j. All streets, except very low-capacity streets in limited areas, shall provide curb separated sidewalks
on both sides. Sidewalks on one side may be allowed on cul-de-sacs of 500 feet or less in length or
where special site conditions apply.
k. The two emergency vehicle access connections through open space corridors shall not be removed
or improved to through connections for collector or local streets without public hearings and an
amendment to this Specific Plan
l. Specific roadway, pedestrian and bicycle connection design elements shall be incorporated into
Tentative Map or other development permit design as specified in Chapter 9, and the Development
Title.
m. Multi-family development shall conform to the design criteria in Chapter 4 and the Mountain House
Multi-Family Development Design Manual dated March 19, 2004, as amended.
n. The Final Map shall comply with applicable policies of SP III and all other Community Approvals, as
amended by the application, including incorporation of the following features as applicable:
• varied lot sizes, lotting configurations, and approximate lot size proportions shown on the Tentative
Map;
• second units on specified lots, unless amended as per the Development Title;
• parks, open space, and trail features;
• street frontage treatment along the power line easement open space corridor, and
• neighborhood center design that incorporates the Neighborhood Commercial Area, Neighborhood
Park and Elementary Schools shown on the map.

3.2.6 Mixed-Use, Commercial, Office and Industrial Land Uses
3.2.6.1 Master Plan Summary
In order to ensure a balanced community, the Master Plan provides mixed-use, commercial and Industrial
uses to provide jobs and needed services for the residents of the community. The land uses are described
below.
Mixed-Use
The Mixed-Use area is included within the I-205 Mixed Use Planning Area and will provide an integration
of office, retail, recreation, public, and high-density residential uses. The M/X designation allows for more
urban densities, innovative design, and efficient land and infrastructure utilization. Residential uses may
be accommodated within vertically or horizontally integrated, M/X buildings or as stand-alone structures.
Residential density will be the same as that for the R/H designation.
Neighborhood Commercial
Neighborhood Commercial provides for small, localized retail and service businesses that offer goods and
merchandise, located within easy pedestrian and bicycle access to the immediate neighborhood. Typical
uses include a mini grocery, barber shop, cleaners, real estate offices, or similar businesses. These sites
may also include professional services such as physician’s offices; telecommuting centers, childcare,
group care and other public or institutional uses; and indoor or outdoor recreation uses including swimming
pools.

Office Commercial
Office Commercial areas support administrative and professional office development. The Master Plan
locates Office Commercial uses along Mountain House Parkway and De Anza Blvd.
Limited Industrial
Limited Industrial areas are intended to accommodate modern business park developments that provide
little or no nuisance activities and are therefore suitable for location along major community roadways and
near residential neighborhoods. Typical uses include light manufacturing, electronics, high technology
businesses, and light warehousing, as well as office uses to support these functions. The primary location
of Limited Industrial land use occurs in the Mountain House Business Parks area between Mountain House
Parkway and De Anza Boulevard Specific Plan Area I
3.2.6.2 Specific Plan III Description
Mixed-Use
SP III provides 16.0 acres for opportunities to develop mixed-use developments which adhere to the
development standards discussed in this Specific Plan. The exact nature of the mixed-use development
type is not known at this time and is planned to be in close proximity to the Delta College Campus as well
as the planned Business Park Development adjacent to Mountain House Parkway.
Neighborhood Commercial Center
SP III provides a 1.5-acre Neighborhood Commercial Center located across the street from the
Neighborhood Park and one K-8 school. The design and character of the Neighborhood Commercial
Center shall be compatible with and reinforce the character of the adjacent K-8 school and residential
uses, with the Special Purpose Plan (see Chapter 4) providing landscaping and architectural guidance.
As Mission/Spanish Colonial is the architectural style to be used for the school in Neighborhood A/B, the
neighborhood commercial area shall use this style. The Neighborhood Commercial Center is intended to
serve the local, pedestrian-oriented shopping needs within the neighborhood and to help offset the need
for longer vehicular trips to other commercial areas. The Neighborhood Commercial Center is accessible
by foot or bicycle and is designed to contribute to a neighborhood focus. Access to the retail facilities is
located on a residential collector street, away from school and schoolyard entrances.
The Neighborhood Commercial Center has been designed to accommodate retail and space for a
community facility such as a day care center, recreation building, or meeting hall. Anticipated building
development is from 8,000 to 15,000 square feet. Generally, one half of the area of a Neighborhood
Commercial Center site shall be reserved for retail commercial uses. It is located adjacent to the power
line easement which allows the added benefit of connecting to the neighborhood open space corridor
system. Outdoor dining areas, pedestrian plazas, and sitting areas of the Neighborhood Commercial
Center will link to this trail system. Parking, meeting Development Title standards, is proposed on site
with additional parking allowed on the collector’s street. Off-street parking will be located in small parking
lots, at the sides and rear of buildings.

The Master Plan Land Use Map and Land Use Designations of Section 3.2 are implemented through the
Zoning Map and Development Standards, presented below, which are adopted by ordinance and amend
the San Joaquin County Development Title. This Chapter identifies zoning districts that implement the SP
III land use designations (see Table 3-4: Implementing Zones for Master Plan Land Use Designations).
Figure 3-4: Specific Plan III Map Zoning Diagram establishes the location and categories of zoning districts
within SP III area in accordance with the Master Plan, the County General Plan and Development Title.
With the exception of the M-X Zone, the Development Standards in this chapter set forth maximum
buildouts, minimum lot size, setbacks, lot coverage, height, and permitted uses and override any
conflicting requirements within the San Joaquin County Mountain House Development Title. For
development standards associated with the M-X Zone, refer to Chapter 9-700M of the San Joaquin County
Mountain House Development Title, Appendix 1.

c. For each lot or parcel designated to contain a second unit dwelling, building permits for the primary
single-family dwelling and the second unit shall be issued concurrently. The final inspection for the
second unit dwelling shall also take place concurrently with the final inspection for the primary single
family dwelling.
3.3.7 Senior Housing
3.3.7.1 Master Plan Summary
Specific Plans shall consider the need for additional senior housing sites and shall designate sites where
such a need is determined and determine a method to reserve the sites for seniors. The R-H and R-MH
sites indicated for Senior Housing by the Land Use Plan shall be developed primarily as Senior Housing,
unless the need for such housing is determined not to exist during preparation of SP III.
3.3.7.2 Specific Plan III Description
No need for additional senior housing sites has been identified within the boundaries of this Specific Plan.
The sites designated for senior housing by the Master Plan are located within Specific Plan II. In addition,
over 2,000 units of active adult senior housing are proposed within Specific Plan II. Therefore, no
additional senior housing sites must be identified in SP III.
3.3.8 Development Design Consistency Review

the SP III planning area.
3.4 Jobs/Housing and Affordable Housing
A primary goal of the Mountain House community is to establish a close balance between employment
and housing. To this end, the Master Plan establishes two distinct but interrelated programs:
• The Jobs/Housing Program, crafted to ensure that jobs are available to working residents of the
community, and
• The Affordable Housing Program, designed to ensure that homes are available and affordable to
employees within the community.


Mountain House SP III ..................................................................................................................................................................................
3-39 Revised 11/22/05, 5/14/2024
3.4.1 Jobs/Housing Program
3.4.1.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan's jobs/housing program is intended to ensure that jobs and a corresponding amount of
affordable housing are available to working residents in Mountain House, with a jobs/housing ratio target
of 0.76 at buildout of the community. A number of programs will be developed to ensure a balance
between employment and housing. These programs include:
• The job attraction program shall involve passive forms of marketing, emphasizing community design,
the locational benefits of the community, and the information dissemination features of the monitoring
program. Assisting applicants to facilitate projects and assuring an inventory of sites that are ready to
develop shall be elements of the program as well.
• As part of an overall economic development program, specific job development efforts shall offer
various incentives to prospective developers and tenants. In addition, there shall be close coordination
with a network of brokers specializing in commercial and industrial land uses to target specific
industries and companies, and to mount a recruiting effort that may be international in scope. Other
commercial and industrial developers, the San Joaquin Partnership, and the County shall be integrated
into the program.
The San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors shall hold a Public Hearing referred to as a Jobs/Housing
Review to review the progress of the jobs/housing program at the following specified times:
• Prior to the approval of any Specific Plan that contains residential development, but no sooner than after
2,000 residential units have been constructed (excluding the first Specific Plan or Specific Plan
Amendment).
• When 4,000, 8,000, 12,000, and 16,000 residential units have been completed and annual monitoring
information becomes available, if a review has not already been conducted in the previous calendar
year.
• At any other times determined appropriate by the Board of Supervisors (e.g., scheduling of a Jobs/
Housing Review by the Board to evaluate the circumstances for non-achievement of jobs/housing
ratios).
The Master Plan used the following assumptions:
• Employed Residents per Household: An average of 1.70 employed residents (full-time equivalents)
per household is assumed. This value is assumed to be constant throughout project development.
• Non-Residential Absorption: The absorption of certain non-residential land uses (e.g., Neighborhood
Commercial, Community Commercial, public uses such as schools and parks) relates directly to the
residential absorption due to the demand for basic retail goods and services by residents in the
community. These land uses follow residential absorption with a short lag. Other non-residential land
uses (e.g., General Commercial, Industrial) are assumed to be absorbed after a sufficient employment
base exists in the community and after maturing of the job creation program.
• Jobs have been assumed to follow housing by an average delay of three years.

Mountain House SP III
..................................................................................................................................................................................
.................................................................................................................................................................................. 3 - 40 11/22/05, 5/14/2024
The Master Plan directs that programs shall be instituted to attract and develop jobs in the community.
Job development activities shall target specific types of industry that tend to offer higher salaries, including:
• biomedical, biotech, bioengineering
• professional health care services
• high-tech (i.e., chip manufacturing, software development)
• voice and data communication hardware and services
• financial services, real estate, accounting and legal services
Land use allocations and regulatory controls shall support a jobs/housing balance, and land use changes
or regulatory changes will not be made without giving consideration to the effects on a jobs/housing
balance. The primary emphasis of the Jobs/Housing Program shall be to rely on market forces to attain
desired jobs/housing goals, rather than on overt governmental action, such as restricting residential
development, to correct jobs/housing imbalances. Non-residential land uses shall generally conform to
the minimum job densities presented in Master Plan Table 3-1: Land Use Summary by Neighborhood.
Redesignation and rezoning of commercial and industrial land to non-employment uses (such as
residential uses) shall be approved only if the County determines that the proposed redesignation or
rezoning will not have a negative impact on the Mountain House Jobs/Housing and Affordable Housing
Programs.
3.4.1.2 Specific Plan III Description
A balance of residential and employment uses is provided within the SP III planning area such that the
jobs-housing balance set forth in the Master Plan is maintained. The total of 1,804 jobs are anticipated for
the expected 3,631 employees residing within SP III for a community wide jobs/housing ratio of 0.76.
3.4.1.3 Implementation Measures
a. All development projects shall comply with the Mountain House Jobs/Housing Program contained in
Master Plan Section 3.9.2. All development lands shall also comply with the applicable provisions of
Development Agreements adopted for projects within the SP III planning area.
3.4.2 Affordable Housing Program
3.4.2.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan's affordable housing program is intended to ensure that housing is available and
affordable to all employees in Mountain House. Households at every income level shall be able to find
housing that is affordable. Assistance shall be made available to fill affordability gaps for specified
households that cannot find affordable housing. The primary emphasis of the Affordable Housing


Mountain House SP III ..................................................................................................................................................................................
.................................................................................................................................................................................. 12/8/2015 3–41
Program shall be to rely on market forces, coupled with land use design and density constraints, to dictate
the appropriate number, monthly rents, and sales prices of dwelling units within the community. Rezoning
of higher density residential land (e.g., R/H) to lower density land (e.g., R/M) uses shall be approved only
if the County determines that the proposed rezoning will not have a negative impact on the Mountain
House Jobs/Housing Program and the Affordable Housing Program.
The Mountain House Housing Trust Fund (MHHTF) was created by the County for the purpose of providing
funding for affordable housing development in Mountain House. The MHHTF receives revenues
generated by the Affordable Housing Impact Fee. The Affordable Housing Impact Fee is levied against
all new residential development in Mountain House, except second unit dwellings, Density Bonus Units,
and Additional Town Center Units, and is payable at the time of building permit issuance. Non-residential
land uses are not subject to the fee.
3.4.2.2 Specific Plan III Description
SP III emphasizes affordable housing by design through providing a wide variety of housing types and lot
sizes including approximately 742 single family units on small lots of 3,600 square feet or less, with a
requirement that a minimum number of small homes be built as noted in Table 3-7: Lot and Structure
Standards – Residential Districts.
Approximately 270 multi-family townhomes or condominiums are also proposed as well as 338 apartment
units and opportunities for additional multi-family housing in the Mixed-Use area of the plan. These all
represent a substantial increase in the number of R-MH, R-H and M-X housing units.
Additionally, the requirement for second unit dwellings which can facilitate affordable housing has been
increased from 6.5% per the Master Plan to 10% as a requirement for SP III. The Affordable Housing
Program is designed to be implementation-oriented and includes the implementation measures below.


Mountain House SP III
..................................................................................................................................................................................
.................................................................................................................................................................................. 3 - 42 Revised 12/11/12
3.4.2.3 Implementation Measures
a. Residential and non-residential land uses shall be developed generally as proposed in this Specific
Plan including:
• Diversity in housing types, square footage and costs.
• Variety of lot sizes and housing types. Refer to design standards manual for criteria related to
proposed housing types.
• Small house requirements for lots less than 3,600 square feet as provided for in footnote 6 of Table
3-7: Lot and Structure Standards – Residential Districts.
• Second units on 10% of the lots designated R-VL, R-L, and R-M.
b. County incentives set forth in the Development Title shall be considered for all medium-high density
residential (R-MH) and high density residential (R-H) developments to encourage participation in the
affordable housing program.
c. Employers shall be encouraged to extend incentives to their employees who wish to live in Mountain
House and to help address any affordability gaps that may be present in the community by contributing
to the Mountain House Housing Trust Fund and/or, to providing down payment assistance, mortgage
buy-downs, temporary collateral against mortgages, or other incentives.
d. Development shall be subject to the payment of all applicable affordable housing impact fees as set
forth in the Development Title.
e. All implementing projects shall comply with the Mountain House Affordable Housing Program
contained in Master Specific Plan Section 3.9.3, and the Affordable Housing Ordinance and Technical
Report adopted May 26, 1998, or as amended in the future.

3.5 Mineral Rights
3.5.1 Plan Description
Several of the existing parcels within Specific Plan III have mineral rights with rights to surface access by
third party mineral rights owners (see Figure 3-5: Mineral Rights Map). Such rights enable the owners to
explore and extract mineral resources that may exist below the subject properties. Several conceptual
surface entry locations have been identified within the area of Specific Plan III as depicted on Figure 3-5.
Potential sites, as identified on Figure 3-5 take into consideration criteria identified below, which attempts
to preserve the mineral right holders’ ability to search for and extract if found, mineral resources below the
identified parcels while, 1) preserving the landowners rights to develop the property consistent with the
terms of the Master Plan and this Specific Plan and, 2) minimizing the impacts to ultimate adjacent uses
and occupants. The identified sites are preferred sites, but may be relocated as necessary to accomplish
the following criteria, which seeks to balance a series of potentially competing interests including:
• Minimizing disruption to and disturbing the continuity of residential uses and neighborhoods;
• Avoiding locations near school facilities;
• Locating facilities near prominent public arterial road rights of way, where conveyance pipelines may
exist or be placed by the extractor;
• Facilitate, as practicable, convenient access for service vehicles and equipment.
3.5.2 SP III Implementation Measures
a. Surface Entry Rights to Access Minerals. In accordance with applicable law, a surface entry site may
be provided on original parcels encumbered by third party surface entry rights to access minerals. To
the maximum extent possible, these sites will be located in public areas such as Community Parks
and Planned Industrial sites and shall be located to allow convenient vehicular access. Siting criteria
will also consider pipeline conveyance routes to existing off-site transmission pipelines. All extraction
and conveyance facilities shall specifically be located away from school facilities, and shall to the
greatest extent possible, avoid being located within any Neighborhood within Mountain House. Drilling
and well site operators shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, County and MHCSD code
requirements.

CHAPTER FOUR: DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN
4.1 Introduction
This Chapter presents development and design plans and guidelines, including design concepts for
focus areas, and states implementation measures for Specific Plan III (SP III). The design guidelines
in this Chapter address private residential, commercial, office, and industrial development. The
Mountain House Community Services District (MHCSD) Design Manual addresses development
within public areas.
4.2 Overall Development and Design
This section summarizes development and design provisions from the Master Plan, presents the design plans for SP III, and identifies implementation for SP III.
4.2.1 Development Design Concept
4.2.1.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan provides policies to create attractive, identifiable neighborhoods and establish a local
street network that facilitates easy access within neighborhoods and contributes to an attractive
residential setting with varied, interesting street environments. Local streets within neighborhoods are
to be designed to disperse traffic and create a comfortable pedestrian scale. Residential street layouts
are also to optimize the ability of residences to use solar energy. The use of rear alleys is encouraged
for homes along streets fronting neighborhood centers and along Arterials including Central Parkway.
Public open spaces and uses are to front onto public streets to the greatest degree possible in order
to give character and beauty to the street.
Neighborhood A and D is to contain a Neighborhood Center which includes a K-8 school, a
Neighborhood Park, a Neighborhood Commercial area, and a transit stop. Each neighborhood is also
to include a mix of residential housing types for residents with a variety of income levels, providing
diversity and choice for residents.
The Master Plan requires that Design Guidelines consistent with the Master Plan and other County
and MHCSD adopted plans for Mountain House be submitted for administrative review prior to
approval of Final Maps, Parcel Maps or other development permits in residential areas.
4.2.1.2 Specific Plan III Description
SP III represents an opportunity to develop a unique community combining the best aspects of master
planned development with best building types and styles of long-established neighborhoods
...........................................................................................................................................................................
4 – 1 Revised 11/22/05, 5/21/2024


Mountain House Specific Plan III
...........................................................................................................................................................................
(See Figure 4-1: Illustrative Concept Plan). One key to the success of the community is the appropriate
architectural vocabulary and theme. The SP III planning area has been named “College Park”
providing an academic orientation to the southern portion of Mountain House due to its adjacency to
the Community College. Neighborhood entry design for the portion of Neighborhood D in SP III will
be in an Italianate style, consistent with that used for the Specific Plan II (SP II) portion of
Neighborhood D, so that Neighborhood D appears as a cohesive neighborhood. Detailed design
standards developed for residential areas in SP III will apply to that portion of Neighborhood D in SP
III.
4.2.2 Landscape Design
4.2.2.1 Master Plan Summary
The Master Plan proposes that the Mountain House landscape create a diverse, stable environment
in keeping with the landscape patterns of the San Joaquin Valley that utilize long-lived and low
maintenance plant species that are native to the region or well-adapted to the climatic and soils
conditions of the site. Landscape improvements will require minimal maintenance and irrigation and
maximize the use of native and drought tolerant plant materials. These provisions are described and
implemented through the design guidelines in this Specific Plan and the MHCSD Design Manual.
SP III shall describe any specific landscape provisions that are applicable only to the Specific Plan III
Area, such as tree selection for Collector streets, designated accent trees for each neighborhood, and
typical design of entries including species and placement. The landscaping plans included in SP III
shall be consistent with the MHCSD Design Manual and will be reviewed and approved by the MHCSD
prior to construction.
4.2.2.2 Specific Plan III Description
The landscape concept for SP III includes several distinct landscape zones, where a consistent
treatment of streets and common areas occurs (see Figure 4-2: Landscaping Framework Diagram).
Foremost to the landscape plan are the Arterial and Collector road connections that link SP III to the
rest of the community and the open space corridor system, including the corridors that follow the
transmission line and pipeline easements. Mountain House Parkway, De Anza Boulevard, Central
Parkway, Grant Line Road, and the transmission corridor all connect or share linkages with the
Mountain House neighborhoods to the north. The Collector road and open space corridor landscape
provides consistency in the neighborhood street scene and a common thread to the community.
Landscape and hardscape will be used to reinforce other community design elements such as
architecture, walls/fences and entries. Individual neighborhoods and residential enclaves will be
distinguished by varied planting themes, although still united by a common regional character.
Streetscape will be consistent with the design criteria currently established within Specific Plan I (SP
I) and shall conform to the MHCSD Design Manual and design guidelines specific to neighborhoods
within SP III.

The landscape combines the historic agricultural heritage of the region with the Mountain House new
town character. Exotic and dramatic impact statements (palms, Italian Cypress) will be used sparingly
in lieu of more subtle, regional backdrops (sycamore, oak and cottonwood) more characteristic to the
area. The generous use of native and naturalized species are promoted to provide a rustic, informal
character and sense of transition from the Mountain House new town to the San Joaquin County
“countryside.”
A variety of windbreak landscape treatments are to be used to help define use areas and establish
visual points of reference and provide protection from the prevailing winds of the areas. The prevailing
winds from the west require the optimal location for the windbreaks to be in a north-south direction.
Windbreaks of trees will be utilized within parks and school sites and with other land uses as needed
to provide wind relief, and to provide visual identity. The location of windbreak areas is shown in Figure
4-2: Landscape Framework Diagram. Large canopy tree species are proposed for the windbreaks.
Windbreaks are also required to buffer the Neighborhood Parks and the Community Park. Mountain
House Parkway and DeAnza Boulevard are also planted with Poplars in the medians, providing a
windbreak, as well as perimeter canopy trees to create a buffer to the easterly existing agricultural
fields and industrial developments. Poplars are also proposed at the west side of the community
college, acting as a buffer against the strong winds blowing in over the adjacent agriculture fields.
Selective use of windbreaks is also required on the Industrial Parcels to create an identifying character
for the Industrial Park. Wherever possible, the orientation of the windbreaks should be north-south.
Street Character
As in most mid 20th Century San Joaquin Valley towns, tree-lined streets represent a tradition of good
neighborhood value and character. Streets and the landscape areas occurring in medians, parkway
strips and adjacent buffer landscaping are a major component of the Mountain House open space
corridor system. These areas convey the immediate impression of the overall community image,
provide pedestrian and circulation routes, and provide a landscape interface between traffic corridors
and adjacent land uses. All streets in the neighborhoods will have curb-separated sidewalks with
continuous tree planting. The landscape character of each neighborhood shall be different from
adjoining neighborhoods and shall generally be consistent throughout the neighborhood. Typical
street cross-sections are shown in Figures 4-3 to 4-10.

Central Parkway is the icon street of the community and is envisioned as the “parade route” of the
community. It has a distinctive character as it threads through the entire community from south to
north acting as a strong community linkage element. Central Parkway will be dominated by groves of
canopy trees with occasional vertical tree species or colorful deciduous trees at nodal or accent points
along the Parkway. The character is informal, with heavily shaded street corridors, with sidewalks
separated from the roadway by a planted parkway strip. All planting shall be consistent with the
MHCSD Design Manual.
De Anza Boulevard, Mountain House Parkway and Grant Line Road will incorporate the existing
character already developed for these Arterial roads and shall be consistent with the MHCSD Design
Manual. Enhanced parkways such as the trail systems along these Arterial roadways will provide a
buffer to the adjacent residential, commercial and industrial uses, and soften the sound wall impact of
these Arterial roads.
Landscaping will be used to help identify the hierarchy of the neighborhood street system, from Arterial
roads to interior local streets, creating defined pedestrian corridors (See Figure 4-11: Typical Local
Street Landscape Cross Section). This will be accomplished through variation in palette, size, color
and character.

Open Space
The landscape concept for the SP III open space corridor system consists of informal groupings of
canopy trees located around the perimeter areas, the Community Park, the neighborhood open space
corridor system within the power and gas line easements and continuing into the Neighborhood Parks
extending into the school play areas. Large canopy trees will be the dominant tree theme, maximizing
shade and cooling opportunities. Vertical accent trees may be used as background features or to
identify high use areas in the park interior. Additionally flowering deciduous trees may be used in
accent conditions to vary the evergreen effect. The ground plane will be predominantly rolling lawn
and areas of mass planting shrubs and groundcover used to screen residential or direct pedestrian
traffic along trail systems. Background trees should be vertical buffer trees with evergreen foreground
massing trees to provide layered buffer conditions. Effort should be made to select native, drought
tolerant shrubs and groundcovers. All plantings in public open space corridor areas shall be consistent
with the MHCSD Design Manual and the tree palettes in the Design Manual. All plantings in private
yards and open space corridor areas shall be consistent with the County-approved Design Guidelines
for that subdivision or project.
Schools and Public Facility Landscape
The public facility landscape features will include low maintenance, large spreading canopy of trees
and a predominant lawn landscape. The adjacent road landscape would also reflect the tree theme
and palette. Evergreen accent trees will be provided at selected areas. A double row of canopy trees
is provided adjacent to the school with a decomposed granite (DG) trail. All plantings in public school
and Public Facility areas shall be consistent with the MHCSD Design Manual. All plantings in private
schools shall be consistent with the County-approved Design Guidelines for that project. The
Community College perimeter and entrances shall meet the requirements set forth in the Delta College
Design Manual.

Residential Landscape
Landscaping along local streets creates a network of tree-lined, pedestrian-scale streets, with each
street or local area utilizing a distinct tree species and character. Sidewalks along local streets are
separated by a planted parkway strip on both sides of the roadway, except in limited areas that may
be subject to site constraints. The intent in the neighborhood parcels is to provide individuality although
maintaining a dominant street tree theme with accent trees specific to each neighborhood. Adjacent
sub-areas with connecting local roads should have a consistent street tree theme although providing
varied deciduous accent trees and special landscape features.
Neighborhood D
The creation of a consistent Neighborhood D landscape between areas within SP II and SP III is to be
achieved through coordination of neighborhood entry and street treatment. Mountain House Parkway
and De Anza Boulevard will maintain the consistent landscape and street character emphasized for
these community arterial road conditions, and Prosperity Street, which runs along the western
boundary of the SP III Neighborhood area, shall be consistent with the street themes of this
neighborhood. The distinction for the Neighborhood D component within SP III will be the landscape
enhancement of the power line easement running diagonally between the residential enclaves. A
neighborhood trail system with tree planting along the perimeter of the easement provides a useful
open space corridor system, enhancing the visual open space character and sense of pedestrian
connectivity in this neighborhood area. Connections between the trail and local street sidewalks shall
be provided at intersections adjacent to the easement. Where local streets front on the easement, a
sidewalk on the trail side of the street is not required as long as adequate connections to the trail are
provided.
College Landscape
The College landscape shall meet the requirements set forth in the Delta College Design Manual.
Landscaping along public streets will comply with the MHCSD Design Manual. All plant materials will
comply with the approved plant list in the respective Design Manuals. Central Parkway landscape is
to reflect criteria as set forth for Central Parkway discussed above. College campus landscaping
should be compatible with landscaping within Neighborhood A/B.
High Density Residential, Mixed Use Industrial and Business Park Landscape
The landscape concept for high density residential, mixed-use, industrial and business park areas
emphasizes the consistent treatment of street corridors, the placement of vertical accent tree plantings
at parcel entries to demarcate large single-user parcels, and the planting of vertical trees at major use
areas. Accent trees will be used in groups or regular groves at building entries, patios, courtyards,
employee gathering areas or other special areas. Setback landscaping will create an effective
separation/buffer between uses and parcels. In addition to providing protection from the prevailing
winds of the areas, a variety of windbreak landscape treatments shall be used whenever practical, to
help define use areas and establish visual points of reference.
